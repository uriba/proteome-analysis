Here, we report proteome-wide steady-state protein turnover rate measurements for the evolutionarily distant but ecologically similar yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We find that the half-life of most proteins is much longer than currently thought and determined to a large degree by protein synthesis and dilution due to cell division. However, we detect a significant subset of proteins (âˆ¼15{\%}) in both yeasts that are turned over rapidly. In addition, the relative abundances of orthologous proteins between the two yeasts are highly conserved across the 400 million years of evolution. In contrast, their respective turnover rates differ considerably. Our data provide a high-confidence resource for studying protein degradation in common yeast model systems.},

(p)ppGpp/DksA exert differential effects on promoters by playing upon their intrinsic kinetic parameters, and by facilitating the utilization of alternative sigma factors.

abstract ={Genetically identical cells exposed to the same environment display variability in gene expression (noise), with important consequences for the fidelity of cellular regulation and biological function. Although population average gene expression is tightly coupled to growth-rate, the effects of changes in environmental conditions on expression variability are not known. Here, we measure the single-cell expression distributions of ~900 S. cerevisiae promoters across four environmental conditions using flow cytometry, and find that gene expression noise is tightly coupled to the environment and is generally higher at lower growth rates. Nutrient-poor conditions, which support lower growth rates, display elevated levels of noise for most promoters, regardless of their specific expression values. We present a simple model of noise in expression that results from having an asynchronous population, with cells at different cell cycle stages, and with different partitioning of the cells between the stages at different growth rates. This model predicts non-monotonic global changes in noise at different growth rates as well as overall higher noise for cell cycle regulated genes in all conditions. The consistency between this model and our data, as well as with noise measurements of cells growing in a chemostat at well-defined growth rates, suggests that cell-cycle heterogeneity is a major contributor to gene expression noise. Finally, we identify gene and promoter features that play a role in gene expression noise across conditions. Our results show the existence of growth-related global changes in gene expression noise and suggest their potential phenotypic implications in noise-driven processes, such as persistence, survival after treatment and responsiveness to fluctuating environments.},

In many cases, a chemist might devise a simpler route for the biochemical transformation, so why has nature chosen such complex solutions? In this review, we distill lessons from a century of metabolic research and introduce new observations suggesting that the intricate structure of metabolic pathways can be explained by a small set of biochemical principles. Using glycolysis as an example, we demonstrate how three key biochemical constraints--thermodynamic favorability, availability of enzymatic mechanisms and the physicochemical properties of pathway intermediates--eliminate otherwise plausible metabolic strategies. Considering these constraints, glycolysis contains no unnecessary steps and represents one of the very few pathway structures that meet cellular demands. The analysis presented here can be applied to metabolic engineering efforts for the rational design of pathways that produce a desired product while satisfying biochemical constraints.},

Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

  abstract = {The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent catabolite repression effect in Escherichia coli is among the most intensely studied regulatory processes in biology. However, the physiological function(s) of cAMP signalling and its molecular triggers remain elusive. Here we use a quantitative physiological approach to show that cAMP signalling tightly coordinates the expression of catabolic proteins with biosynthetic and ribosomal proteins, in accordance with the cellular metabolic needs during exponential growth. The expression of carbon catabolic genes increased linearly with decreasing growth rates upon limitation of carbon influx, but decreased linearly with decreasing growth rate upon limitation of nitrogen or sulphur influx. In contrast, the expression of biosynthetic genes showed the opposite linear growth-rate dependence as the catabolic genes. A coarse-grained mathematical model provides a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting gene expression responses to catabolic and anabolic limitations. A scheme of integral feedback control featuring the inhibition of cAMP signalling by metabolic precursors is proposed and validated. These results reveal a key physiological role of cAMP-dependent catabolite repression: to ensure that proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic sectors as needed in different nutrient environments. Our findings underscore the power of quantitative physiology in unravelling the underlying functions of complex molecular signalling networks.},

To measure the noise intrinsic to eukaryotic gene expression, we quantified the differences in expression of two alleles in a diploid cell. We found that such noise is gene-specific and not dependent on the regulatory pathway or absolute rate of expression. We propose a model in which the balance between promoter activation and transcription influences the variability in messenger RNA levels. To confirm the predictions of our model, we identified both cis- and trans-acting mutations that alter the noise of gene expression. These mutations suggest that noise is an evolvable trait that can be optimized to balance fidelity and diversity in eukaryotic gene expression.},

We identify supply-driven feedforward activation of ribosomal protein synthesis as the key regulatory motif maximizing amino acid flux, and autonomously guiding a cell to achieve optimal growth in different environments. The growth laws emerge naturally from the robust regulatory strategy underlying growth rate control, irrespective of the details of the molecular implementation. The study highlights the interplay between phenomenological modeling and molecular mechanisms in uncovering fundamental operating constraints, with implications for endogenous and synthetic design of microorganisms.},

  abstract = {Here we studied the quantitative behaviour and cell-to-cell variability of a prototypical eukaryotic cell-fate decision system, the mating pheromone response pathway in yeast. We dissected and measured sources of variation in system output, analysing thousands of individual, genetically identical cells. Only a small proportion of total cell-to-cell variation is caused by random fluctuations in gene transcription and translation during the response ('expression noise'). Instead, variation is dominated by differences in the capacity of individual cells to transmit signals through the pathway ('pathway capacity') and to express proteins from genes ('expression capacity'). Cells with high expression capacity express proteins at a higher rate and increase in volume more rapidly. Our results identify two mechanisms that regulate cell-to-cell variation in pathway capacity. First, the MAP kinase Fus3 suppresses variation at high pheromone levels, while the MAP kinase Kss1 enhances variation at low pheromone levels. Second, pathway capacity and expression capacity are negatively correlated, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that allows cells to respond more precisely to pheromone in the presence of a large variation in expression capacity.},

Simultaneous specific and global regulation thus constitutes an additional--but often neglected--layer of complexity in gene expression. Here, we develop an experimental-computational approach to dissect specific and global regulation in the bacterium Escherichia coli. By using fluorescent promoter reporters, we show that global regulation is growth rate dependent not only during steady state but also during dynamic changes in growth rate and can be quantified through two promoter-specific parameters. By applying our approach to arginine biosynthesis, we obtain a quantitative understanding of both specific and global regulation that allows accurate prediction of the temporal response to simultaneous perturbations in arginine availability and growth rate. We thereby uncover two principles of joint regulation: (i) specific regulation by repression dominates the transcriptional response during metabolic steady states, largely repressing the biosynthesis genes even when biosynthesis is required and (ii) global regulation sets the maximum promoter activity that is exploited during the transition between steady states.},

First, an impressive array of quantitative measurements make it possible to develop intuition about biological numbers ranging from how many gigatons of atmospheric carbon are fixed every year in the process of photosynthesis to the number of membrane transporters needed to provide sugars to rapidly dividing Escherichia coli cells. As a result of the vast array of such quantitative data, the BioNumbers web site has recently been developed as a repository for biology by the numbers. Second, a complementary and powerful tradition of numerical estimates familiar from the physical sciences and canonized in the so-called Fermi problems calls for efforts to estimate key biological quantities on the basis of a few foundational facts and simple ideas from physics and chemistry. In this article, we describe these two approaches and illustrate their synergism in several particularly appealing case studies.

Here we test for the existence of this trade-off by analyzing the growth characteristics of 12 E. coli B populations that evolved for 20,000 generations under a constant selection regime. We performed three different tests. First, we analyzed changes in growth rate and yield over evolutionary time for each population. Second, we tested for a negative correlation between rate and yield across the 12 populations. Finally, we isolated clones from four selected populations and tested for a negative correlation between rate and yield within these populations. We did not find evidence for a trade-off based on the first two tests. However, we did observe a trade-off based on the within-population correlation of yield and rate. Our results indicate that, at least for the populations studied here, an analysis of the within-population diversity might be the most sensitive test for the existence of a trade-off. The observation of a trade-off within, but not between, populations suggests that the populations evolved different genetic solutions for growth in the selective environment, which in turn led to different physiological constraints.},

@article{Dori-Bachash2012,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous work showed that mRNA degradation is coordinated with transcription in yeast, and in several genes the control of mRNA degradation was linked to promoter elements through two different mechanisms. Here we show at the genomic scale that the coordination of transcription and mRNA degradation is promoter-dependent in yeast and is also observed in humans. RESULTS: We first demonstrate that swapping upstream cis-regulatory sequences between two yeast species affects both transcription and mRNA degradation and suggest that while some cis-regulatory elements control either transcription or degradation, multiple other elements enhance both processes. Second, we show that adjacent yeast genes that share a promoter (through divergent orientation) have increased similarity in their patterns of mRNA degradation, providing independent evidence for the promoter-mediated coupling of transcription to mRNA degradation. Finally, analysis of the differences in mRNA degradation rates between mammalian cell types or mammalian species suggests a similar coordination between transcription and mRNA degradation in humans. CONCLUSIONS: Our results extend previous studies and suggest a pervasive promoter-mediated coordination between transcription and mRNA degradation in yeast. The diverse genes and regulatory elements associated with this coordination suggest that it is generated by a global mechanism of gene regulation and modulated by gene-specific mechanisms. The observation of a similar coupling in mammals raises the possibility that coupling of transcription and mRNA degradation may reflect an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon in gene regulation.},

Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA (rrn P1) promoters require high initiating NTP concentrations for efficient transcription because they form unusually short-lived complexes with RNA polymerase; high initiating NTP concentrations [adenosine or guanosine triphosphate (ATP or GTP), depending on the rrn P1 promoter] are needed to bind to and stabilize the open complex.

  abstract = {We have used two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to fractionate tRNAs from Escherichia coli. A sufficiently high degree of resolution was obtained for 44 out of 46 tRNA species in E. coli to be resolved into individual electrophoretic components. These isolated components were identified by hybridization to tRNA-specific oligonucleotide probes. Systematic measurements of the abundance of each individual tRNA isoacceptor in E. coli, grown at rates varying from 0.4 to 2.5 doublings per hour, were made with the aid of this electrophoretic protocol. We find that there is a biased distribution of the tRNA abundance at all growth rates, and that this can be roughly correlated with the values of codon frequencies in the mRNA pools calculated for bacteria growing at different rates. The tRNA species cognate to abundant codons increase in concentration as the growth rate increases but not as dramatically as might be anticipated. The levels of most of the tRNA isoacceptors cognate to less abundant codons remain unchanged with increasing growth rates. The result of these changes in tRNA abundance is that the relative increase in the amounts of major tRNA species in the bacteria growing at the fastest growth rates is more modest than previous estimates from this laboratory suggested. Furthermore, a systematic error in previous estimates of ribosomal RNA content of the bacteria has been detected. This will account for the quantitative discrepancies between the previous and the present data for tRNA abundance.},

Importantly, the sum of quantified proteins by iBAQ and emPAI corresponded with the Lowry total protein quantification, demonstrating applicability of label-free methods for an accurate calculation of protein concentrations at the proteome level. The iBAQ method showed the best correlation between biological replicates, a normal distribution among all protein abundances, and the lowest variation among ribosomal protein abundances, which are expected to have equal amounts. Absolute quantitative proteome data enabled us to evaluate metabolic cost for protein synthesis and apparent catalytic activities of enzymes by integration with flux analysis. All the methods demonstrated similar ATP costs for protein synthesis for different cellular processes and that costs for expressing biomass synthesis related proteins were higher than those for energy generation. Importantly, catalytic activities of energy metabolism enzymes were an order or two higher than those of monomer synthesis. Interestingly, a staircase-like protein expression was demonstrated for most of the transcription units. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

But instead of simplicity, it is becoming evident that bacterial adaptations affect `constants' such as Ks (growth affinity constant) and are, in turn, a complex function of nutrient concentration. Instead of a single affinity, bacteria exhibit a continuum of nutrient scavenging abilities peaking at micromolar sugar levels; there is lower affinity with millimolar or submicromolar glucose in the medium. Similar problems arise in defining parameters such as Y (growth yield constant), because nutrient-limited growth at low exponential growth rates induces a continuum of hunger and starvation responses. Autocatalytic changes to the environment caused by growth (as well as external factors) ensure that bacteria present an ever-adapting interface to the outside world. The regulatory interaction between the organism and environment means that no universal kinetic constants describe bacterial growth.},

Bulk protein abundance measurements of >2,500 proteins in rich and minimal media provide a detailed view of the cellular response to these conditions, and capture many changes not observed by DNA microarray analyses. Our single-cell data argue that noise in protein expression is dominated by the stochastic production/destruction of messenger RNAs. Beyond this global trend, there are dramatic protein-specific differences in noise that are strongly correlated with a protein's mode of transcription and its function. For example, proteins that respond to environmental changes are noisy whereas those involved in protein synthesis are quiet. Thus, these studies reveal a remarkable structure to biological noise and suggest that protein noise levels have been selected to reflect the costs and potential benefits of this variation.},

Here, we demonstrate that yeast promoters can also regulate mRNA decay after the mRNA leaves the nucleus. A conventional yeast promoter consists of a core element and an upstream activating sequence (UAS). We find that changing UASs of a reporter gene without altering the transcript sequence affects the transcript's decay kinetics. A short cis element, comprising two Rap1p-binding sites, and Rap1p itself, are necessary and sufficient to induce enhanced decay of the reporter mRNA. Furthermore, Rap1p stimulates both the synthesis and the decay of a specific population of endogenous mRNAs. We propose that Rap1p association with target promoter in the nucleus affects the composition of the exported mRNP, which in turn regulates mRNA decay in the cytoplasm. Thus, promoters can play key roles in determining mRNA levels and have the capacity to coordinate rates of mRNA synthesis and decay.},

  abstract = {The kinetics of synthesis of ribosomal, nonribosomal, and total protein, and of ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA), were measured in Escherichia coli during a shift-up involving a doubling of specific growth rate. The increase in ribosomal protein synthesis was not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in non-ribosomal protein synthesis. Thus, the average rate of protein synthesis per ribosome increased after the shift. The increase did not occur by an increase in polypeptide chain growth rates. The average growth periods of ribosomal and nonribosomal proteins did not change after a shift, and were constant in cells in balanced growth over a wide range of specific growth rates. The average growth period for ribosomal protein was twice that for nonribosomal protein. The fraction of ribosomes in polyribosomes was found to increase after the shift, accounting for the increase in ribosomal protein synthesis and in protein synthesis per ribosome. These results show that ribosomal protein synthesis is regulated by control of initiation of either transcription or translation of ribosomal protein messenger RNA, by some means other than availability of free ribosomes. If the messenger for ribosomal protein is ribosomal RNA, the conclusions can be extended to apply to regulation of ribosomal RNA synthesis. In support of this, it is shown that ribosomal RNA and ribosomal protein synthesis are closely coordinated during a shift.},

To understand how Escherichia coli partitions its transcriptional resources between its different promoters, we employ a robotic assay using a comprehensive reporter strain library for E. coli to measure promoter activity on a genomic scale at high-temporal resolution and accuracy. This allows continuous tracking of promoter activity as cells change their growth rate from exponential to stationary phase in different media. We find a heavy-tailed distribution of promoter activities, with promoter activities spanning several orders of magnitude. While the shape of the distribution is almost completely independent of the growth conditions, the identity of the promoters expressed at different levels does depend on them. Translation machinery genes, however, keep the same relative expression levels in the distribution across conditions, and their fractional promoter activity tracks growth rate tightly. We present a simple optimization model for resource allocation which suggests that the observed invariant distributions might maximize growth rate. These invariant features of the distribution of promoter activities may suggest design constraints that shape the allocation of transcriptional resources.},

In this study, we investigate control of metabolic flux in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis by quantifying fluxes, transcripts, and metabolites in eight metabolic states enforced by different environmental conditions. We find that most enzymes whose flux switches between on and off states, such as those involved in substrate uptake, exhibit large corresponding transcriptional changes. However, for the majority of enzymes in central metabolism, enzyme concentrations were insufficient to explain the observed fluxes--only for a number of reactions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were enzyme changes approximately proportional to flux changes. Surprisingly, substrate changes revealed by metabolomics were also insufficient to explain observed fluxes, leaving a large role for allosteric regulation and enzyme modification in the control of metabolic fluxes.},

  abstract = {Growth rate regulation in bacteria has been an important issue in bacterial physiology for the past 50 years. This review, using Escherichia coli as a paradigm, summarizes the mechanisms for the regulation of rRNA synthesis in the context of systems biology, particularly, in the context of genome-wide competition for limited RNA polymerase (RNAP) in the cell under different growth conditions including nutrient starvation. The specific location of the seven rrn operons in the chromosome and the unique properties of the rrn promoters contribute to growth rate regulation. The length of the rrn transcripts, coupled with gene dosage effects, influence the distribution of RNAP on the chromosome in response to growth rate. Regulation of rRNA synthesis depends on multiple factors that affect the structure of the nucleoid and the allocation of RNAP for global gene expression. The magic spot ppGpp, which acts with DksA synergistically, is a key effector in both the growth rate regulation and the stringent response induced by nutrient starvation, mainly because the ppGpp level changes in response to environmental cues. It regulates rRNA synthesis via a cascade of events including both transcription initiation and elongation, and can be explained by an RNAP redistribution (allocation) model.},

When addressing fundamental questions related to protein evolution, translation and folding, but also in routine laboratory work, a simple rough estimate of the average wild type abundance of each detectable protein in an organism is often desirable. Here, we introduce a meta-resource dedicated to integrating information on absolute protein abundance levels; we place particular emphasis on deep coverage, consistent post-processing and comparability across different organisms. Publicly available experimental data are mapped onto a common namespace and, in the case of tandem mass spectrometry data, re-processed using a standardized spectral counting pipeline. By aggregating and averaging over the various samples, conditions and cell-types, the resulting integrated data set achieves increased coverage and a high dynamic range. We score and rank each contributing, individual data set by assessing its consistency against externally provided protein-network information, and demonstrate that our weighted integration exhibits more consistency than the data sets individually. The current PaxDb-release 2.1 (at http://pax-db.org/) presents whole-organism data as well as tissue-resolved data, and covers 85,000 proteins in 12 model organisms. All values can be seamlessly compared across organisms via pre-computed orthology relationships.},

Here, we present a genome-wide approach, based on ribosome profiling, for measuring absolute protein synthesis rates. The resultant E. coli data set transforms our understanding of the extent to which protein synthesis is precisely controlled to optimize function and efficiency. Members of multiprotein complexes are made in precise proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional modules are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design. These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is optimized for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine biosynthesis) balances production cost with activity requirements. Our studies reveal how general principles, important both for understanding natural systems and for synthesizing new ones, emerge from quantitative analyses of protein synthesis.},

Such mutants were able to grow for about two mass doublings at a normal rate at the restrictive temperature (42 degrees C). The morphology of the cells formed under these conditions was interpreted by assuming the existence of a generalized system for peptidoglycan growth together with two additional systems which modify the shape of the growing peptidoglycan layer. The results also showed that different fts genes probably control different stages in septation. ftsZ (sulB or sfiB) appears to be required for the earliest step in septation, ftsQ and ftsI (pbpB or sep) are required for a later step or steps, and ftsA is required only for the latest stages in septation.},

  abstract = {Systems biology modeling typically requires quantitative experimental data such as intracellular concentrations or copy numbers per cell. In order to convert population-averaging omics measurement data to intracellular concentrations or cellular copy numbers, the total cell volume and number of cells in a sample need to be known. Unfortunately, even for the often studied model bacterium Escherichia coli this information is hardly available and furthermore, certain measures (e.g. cell volume) are also dependent on the growth condition. In this work, we have determined these basic data for E. coli cells when grown in 22 different conditions so that respective data conversions can be done correctly. First, we determine growth-rate dependent cell volumes. Second, we show that in a 1 ml E. coli sample at an optical density (600 nm) of 1 the total cell volume is around 3.6 $\mathrm{\mu}$l for all conditions tested. Third, we demonstrate that the cell number in a sample can be determined on the basis of the sample's optical density and the cells' growth rate. The data presented will allow for conversion of E. coli measurement data normalized to optical density into volumetric cellular concentrations and copy numbers per cell--two important parameters for systems biology model development.},

  abstract = {The relationship between specific growth rate ($\mu$) and steady-state glucose concentration was investigated for Escherichia coli ML30 in carbon-limited chemostat culture. This was made possible by the development of a method for measuring reducing sugars in culture media in the $\mu$g $\cdot$ 1{-}1-range. Cells initially cultivated in batch culture at high glucose concentrations required long-term adaptation to nutrient-limited growth conditions in the chemostat (between 100{\textendash}200 volume changes at D = 0.6 h{-}1) until steady-state with respect to residual glucose concentration was reached; for adapted cells, however, new steady-state glucose concentrations were usually obtained within less than 10 volume changes. A statistical evaluation of different kinetic models showed that between 0.2 h{-}1 < D < 0.8 h{-}1 the three models proposed by Monod (1942), Shehata and Marr (1971), and Westerhoff et al. (1982) described the data equally well and the applicability of the different models is discussed. Depending on the model used, calculated glucose concentrations supporting half maximum growth rate (Ks) were in the range of 40{\textendash}80 $\mu$g $\cdot$ 1{-}1. The data strongly suggest that the large differences in Ks constants reported in the literature (ranging from 40 $\mu$g $\cdot$ 1{-}1 up to 99 mg $\cdot$ 1{-}1) are due to the use of E. coli cells adapted to different degrees to nutrient-limited growth conditions.

  abstract = {A basic challenge in systems biology is to understand the dynamical behavior of gene regulation networks. Current approaches aim at determining the network structure based on genomic-scale data. However, the network connectivity alone is not sufficient to define its dynamics; one needs to also specify the kinetic parameters for the regulation reactions. Here, we ask whether effective kinetic parameters can be assigned to a transcriptional network based on expression data. We present a combined experimental and theoretical approach based on accurate high temporal-resolution measurement of promoter activities from living cells by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmids. We present algorithms that use these data to assign effective kinetic parameters within a mathematical model of the network. To demonstrate this, we employ a well defined network, the SOS DNA repair system of Escherichia coli. We find a strikingly detailed temporal program of expression that correlates with the functional role of the SOS genes and is driven by a hierarchy of effective kinetic parameter strengths for the various promoters. The calculated parameters can be used to determine the kinetics of all SOS genes given the expression profile of just one representative, allowing a significant reduction in complexity. The concentration profile of the master SOS transcriptional repressor can be calculated, demonstrating that relative protein levels may be determined from purely transcriptional data. This finding opens the possibility of assigning kinetic parameters to transcriptional networks on a genomic scale.},

These precursors are then used to generate the entire biomass of the cell. Are there simplifying principles that can explain the structure of such metabolic networks? Here we address this question by studying central carbon metabolism in E. coli. We use all known classes of enzymes that work on carbohydrates to generate rules for converting compounds and for generating possible paths between compounds. We find that central carbon metabolism is built as a minimal walk between the 12 precursor metabolites that form the basis for biomass and one precursor essential for the positive net ATP balance in glycolysis: every pair of consecutive precursors in the network is connected by the minimal number of enzymatic steps. Similarly, input sugars are converted into precursors by the shortest possible enzymatic paths. This suggests an optimality principle for the structure of central carbon metabolism. The present approach may be used to study other metabolic networks and to design new minimal pathways. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

We present a model-based approach to distinguish between these two effects using time-resolved measurements of promoter activities. We demonstrate the strength of the approach by analyzing a circuit involved in the regulation of carbon metabolism in E. coli. Our results show that the transcriptional response of the network is controlled by the physiological state of the cell and the signaling metabolite cyclic AMP (cAMP). The absence of a strong regulatory effect of transcription factors suggests that they are not the main coordinators of gene expression changes during growth transitions, but rather that they complement the effect of global physiological control mechanisms. This change of perspective has important consequences for the interpretation of transcriptome data and the design of biological networks in biotechnology and synthetic biology.},

Such knowledge of primary structures is certainly the basis of complete understanding of the structure of the ribosome. With the current progress in technology, complete elucidation of the primary structure of all the ribosomal components is probably a matter of time. As indicated in this article, a rough approximation of the three-dimensional structure of ribosomes is likely to emerge soon. Although not mentioned in this article, studies of ribosomes from higher organisms are also progressing. We must, therefore, consider what further studies should be conducted and what kinds of questions we would like to solve. Some groups of investigators aim to elucidate the complete three-dimensional structure of ribosomes and to find out how these complex cell organelles function; they hope to determine the conformational changes of many of the component molecules within the ribosome structure in response to external macromolecules and cofactors engaged in protein synthesis. Such knowledge will also be important in enabling us to understand the regulation of translation of genetic messages. Other groups of investigators aim to elucidate the complex series of events which originate in the transcription of the more than 60 genes and culminate in the formation of the specific structure of the organelle. Complete reproduction in vitro of all the assembly events that occur in vivo should not be difficult to achieve in principle. It should then become possible to study in vitro any factor regulating the biogenesis of the organelle. Although we do not know whether such studies would reveal any new fundamental principle that governs the complex circuits of interconnected macromolecular interactions, the achievement of such a complete in vitro system would represent a necessary step in the comprehensive understanding of biogenesis of organelles, and eventually, of the more complex behavior and genesis of cells (89).},

Basic thermodynamic concepts are used to introduce the idea of steady-state growth in open, biological systems. The classical, sometimes conflicting, definitions of steady-state and balanced growth are presented, and a consistent terminology is proposed. The conditions under which a culture in balanced growth is also in exponential growth and in steady-state growth are indicated. It is pointed out that steady-state growth always implies both balanced and exponential growth, and examples in which the converse does not hold are described. More complex situations are then characterized and the terminology extended accordingly. This leads to the notion of normal growth and growth that can be synchronous or otherwise unbalanced but still reproducible, and to the condition of approximate steady state manifested by growth in batch culture and by asymmetrically dividing cells, which is analysed in some detail.},

By combinatorially pairing genes with a compact set of ribosome-binding sites, we modulate protein abundance by several orders of magnitude. We demonstrate our strategy by using a synthetic operon containing fluorescent proteins to span a 3D color space. Using the same approach, we modulate a recombinant carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to reveal a diversity of phenotypes, each characterized by a distinct carotenoid accumulation profile. In a single combinatorial assembly, we achieve a yield of the industrially valuable compound astaxanthin 4-fold higher than previously reported.

  abstract = {Cells need to allocate their limited resources to express a wide range of genes. To understand how Escherichia coli partitions its transcriptional resources between its different promoters, we employ a robotic assay using a comprehensive reporter strain library for E. coli to measure promoter activity on a genomic scale at high-temporal resolution and accuracy. This allows continuous tracking of promoter activity as cells change their growth rate from exponential to stationary phase in different media. We find a heavy-tailed distribution of promoter activities, with promoter activities spanning several orders of magnitude. While the shape of the distribution is almost completely independent of the growth conditions, the identity of the promoters expressed at different levels does depend on them. Translation machinery genes, however, keep the same relative expression levels in the distribution across conditions, and their fractional promoter activity tracks growth rate tightly. We present a simple optimization model for resource allocation which suggests that the observed invariant distributions might maximize growth rate. These invariant features of the distribution of promoter activities may suggest design constraints that shape the allocation of transcriptional resources.},

@article{Field2008,
  abstract = {The detailed positions of nucleosomes profoundly impact gene regulation and are partly encoded by the genomic DNA sequence. However, less is known about the functional consequences of this encoding. Here, we address this question using a genome-wide map of approximately 380,000 yeast nucleosomes that we sequenced in their entirety. Utilizing the high resolution of our map, we refine our understanding of how nucleosome organizations are encoded by the DNA sequence and demonstrate that the genomic sequence is highly predictive of the in vivo nucleosome organization, even across new nucleosome-bound sequences that we isolated from fly and human. We find that Poly(dA:dT) tracts are an important component of these nucleosome positioning signals and that their nucleosome-disfavoring action results in large nucleosome depletion over them and over their flanking regions and enhances the accessibility of transcription factors to their cognate sites. Our results suggest that the yeast genome may utilize these nucleosome positioning signals to regulate gene expression with different transcriptional noise and activation kinetics and DNA replication with different origin efficiency. These distinct functions may be achieved by encoding both relatively closed (nucleosome-covered) chromatin organizations over some factor binding sites, where factors must compete with nucleosomes for DNA access, and relatively open (nucleosome-depleted) organizations over other factor sites, where factors bind without competition.},

@article{Levy2007,
  abstract = {Cells must adjust their gene expression in order to compete in a constantly changing environment. Two alternative strategies could in principle ensure optimal coordination of gene expression with physiological requirements. First, characters of the internal physiological state, such as growth rate, metabolite levels, or energy availability, could be feedback to tune gene expression. Second, internal needs could be inferred from the external environment, using evolutionary-tuned signaling pathways. Coordination of ribosomal biogenesis with the requirement for protein synthesis is of particular importance, since cells devote a large fraction of their biosynthetic capacity for ribosomal biogenesis. To define the relative contribution of internal vs. external sensing to the regulation of ribosomal biogenesis gene expression in yeast, we subjected S. cerevisiae cells to conditions which decoupled the actual vs. environmentally-expected growth rate. Gene expression followed the environmental signal according to the expected, but not the actual, growth rate. Simultaneous monitoring of gene expression and growth rate in continuous cultures further confirmed that ribosome biogenesis genes responded rapidly to changes in the environments but were oblivious to longer-term changes in growth rate. Our results suggest that the capacity to anticipate and prepare for environmentally-mediated changes in cell growth presented a major selection force during yeast evolution.},

Though the stoichiometry of metabolism is well understood, the multidimensional aspects of metabolic regulation in time and space remain difficult to define, model and engineer. Complex metabolic conversions can be performed by multiple species working cooperatively and exchanging metabolites via structured networks of organisms and resources. Within cells, metabolism is spatially regulated via sequestration in subcellular compartments and through the assembly of multienzyme complexes. Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology have had success in engineering metabolism in the first and second dimensions, designing linear metabolic pathways and channeling metabolic flux. More recently, engineering of the third dimension has improved output of engineered pathways through isolation and organization of multicell and multienzyme complexes. This review highlights natural and synthetic examples of three-dimensional metabolism both inter- and intracellularly, offering tools and perspectives for biological design.},

@article{Rohwer2000,
  abstract = {The kinetic parameters in vitro of the components of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS) in enteric bacteria were collected. To address the issue of whether the behavior in vivo of the PTS can be understood in terms of these enzyme kinetics, a detailed kinetic model was constructed. Each overall phosphotransfer reaction was separated into two elementary reactions, the first entailing association of the phosphoryl donor and acceptor into a complex and the second entailing dissociation of the complex into dephosphorylated donor and phosphorylated acceptor. Literature data on the K(m) values and association constants of PTS proteins for their substrates, as well as equilibrium and rate constants for the overall phosphotransfer reactions, were related to the rate constants of the elementary steps in a set of equations; the rate constants could be calculated by solving these equations simultaneously. No kinetic parameters were fitted. As calculated by the model, the kinetic parameter values in vitro could describe experimental results in vivo when varying each of the PTS protein concentrations individually while keeping the other protein concentrations constant. Using the same kinetic constants, but adjusting the protein concentrations in the model to those present in cell-free extracts, the model could reproduce experiments in vitro analyzing the dependence of the flux on the total PTS protein concentration. For modeling conditions in vivo it was crucial that the PTS protein concentrations be implemented at their high in vivo values. The model suggests a new interpretation of results hitherto not understood; in vivo, the major fraction of the PTS proteins may exist as complexes with other PTS proteins or boundary metabolites, whereas in vitro, the fraction of complexed proteins is much smaller.},

These metabolic networks can be modelled and analysed (computed) to study complex biological functions. In particular, constraints-based in silico models have been used to calculate optimal growth rates on common carbon substrates, and the results were found to be consistent with experimental data under many but not all conditions. Optimal biological functions are acquired through an evolutionary process. Thus, incorrect predictions of in silico models based on optimal performance criteria may be due to incomplete adaptive evolution under the conditions examined. Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 grows sub-optimally on glycerol as the sole carbon source. Here we show that when placed under growth selection pressure, the growth rate of E. coli on glycerol reproducibly evolved over 40 days, or about 700 generations, from a sub-optimal value to the optimal growth rate predicted from a whole-cell in silico model. These results open the possibility of using adaptive evolution of entire metabolic networks to realize metabolic states that have been determined a priori based on in silico analysis.},

Recursive carbon-chain elongation pathways in nature produce fatty acids, polyketides, isoprenoids and $\alpha$-keto acids ($\alpha$KAs), which all use modular or iterative approaches for chain elongation. Recently, an artificial pathway for $\alpha$KA elongation has been built that uses an engineered isopropylmalate synthase to recursively condense acetyl-CoA with $\alpha$KAs. This synthetic approach expands the possibilities for recursive pathways beyond the modular or iterative synthesis of natural products and serves as a case study for understanding the challenges of building recursive pathways from nonrecursive enzymes. There exists the potential to design synthetic recursive pathways far beyond what nature has evolved.},

  abstract = {On induction of cell differentiation, distinct cell phenotypes are encoded by complex genetic networks. These networks can prevent the reversion of established phenotypes even in the presence of significant fluctuations. Here we explore the key parameters that determine the stability of cellular memory by using the yeast galactose-signalling network as a model system. This network contains multiple nested feedback loops. Of the two positive feedback loops, only the loop mediated by the cytoplasmic signal transducer Gal3p is able to generate two stable expression states with a persistent memory of previous galactose consumption states. The parallel loop mediated by the galactose transporter Gal2p only increases the expression difference between the two states. A negative feedback through the inhibitor Gal80p reduces the strength of the core positive feedback. Despite this, a constitutive increase in the Gal80p concentration tunes the system from having destabilized memory to having persistent memory. A model reveals that fluctuations are trapped more efficiently at higher Gal80p concentrations. Indeed, the rate at which single cells randomly switch back and forth between expression states was reduced. These observations provide a quantitative understanding of the stability and reversibility of cellular differentiation states.},

Furthermore, there is need for specific growth rate ($\mu$) dependent absolute quantitative transcriptome and proteome data to understand the molecular relationships for enabling cells to modify $\mu$. We address these questions, for the first time, by presenting regulatory strategies for more efficient metabolism of Escherichia coli at higher $\mu$ by statistical covariance analysis of genome-wide intracellular mRNA and protein concentrations coupled to metabolic flux analysis in the steady state range of $\mu$ = 0.11-0.49 h(-1). Our analyses show dominating post-transcriptional control of protein abundances and post-translational control of flux rates. On average, E. coli achieved five-times faster growth through 3.7-fold increase of apparent catalytic rates of enzymes (kapp) and 2.5-fold increased translation rates, demonstrating the relevance of post-translational regulation for increasing flux throughput. Interestingly, pathways carrying the highest flux showed both high protein abundance and kapp values. Furthermore, co-regulation analysis of enzymatic capacities revealed tightly coupled regulatory dependencies of protein synthesis and RNA precursor synthesis, substrate utilization, biosynthetic and energy generation pathways carrying the highest flux. We also observed metabolic pathway and COG specific protein and metabolic flux control levels, protein expression costs and genome-wide principles for translation efficiency and transcription unit polarity. This work contributes to the much needed quantitative understanding of coordinated gene expression regulation and metabolic flux control. Our findings will also advance modeling and metabolic engineering of industrial strains.},

But instead of simplicity, it is becoming evident that bacterial adaptations affect 'constants' such as K(s) (growth affinity constant) and are, in turn, a complex function of nutrient concentration. Instead of a single affinity, bacteria exhibit a continuum of nutrient scavenging abilities peaking at micromolar sugar levels; there is lower affinity with millimolar or submicromolar glucose in the medium. Similar problems arise in defining parameters such as Y (growth yield constant), because nutrient-limited growth at low exponential growth rates induces a continuum of hunger and starvation responses. Autocatalytic changes to the environment caused by growth (as well as external factors) ensure that bacteria present an ever-adapting interface to the outside world. The regulatory interaction between the organism and environment means that no universal kinetic constants describe bacterial growth.},

  abstract = {The expression of any given bacterial protein is predicted to depend on (i) the transcriptional regulation of the promoter and the translational regulation of its mRNA and (ii) the synthesis and translation of total (bulk) mRNA. This is because total mRNA acts as a competitor to the specific mRNA for the binding of initiation-ready free ribosomes. To characterize the effects of mRNA competition on gene expression, the specific activity of $\beta$-galactosidase expressed from three different promoter-lacZ fusions (Pspc-lacZ, PRNAI-lacZ, and PRNAII-lacZ) was measured (i) in a relA + background during exponential growth at different rates and (ii) in relA + and $\Delta$relA derivatives of Escherichia coli B/r after induction of a mild stringent or a relaxed response to raise or lower, respectively, the level of ppGpp. Expression from all three promoters was stimulated during slow exponential growth or at elevated levels of ppGpp and was reduced during fast exponential growth or at lower levels of ppGpp. From these observations and from other considerations, we propose (i) that the concentration of free, initiation-ready ribosomes is approximately constant and independent of the growth rate and (ii) that bulk mRNA made during slow growth and at elevated levels of ppGpp is less efficiently translated than bulk mRNA made during fast growth and at reduced levels of ppGpp. These features lead to an indirect enhancement in the expression of LacZ (or of any other protein) during growth in media of poor nutritional quality and at increased levels of ppGpp.},

  abstract = {The core promoter is the region in which RNA polymerase II is recruited to the DNA and acts to initiate transcription, but the extent to which the core promoter sequence determines promoter activity levels is largely unknown. Here, we identified several base content and k-mer sequence features of the yeast core promoter sequence that are highly predictive of maximal promoter activity. These features are mainly located in the region 75 bp upstream and 50 bp downstream of the main transcription start site, and their associations hold for both constitutively active promoters and promoters that are induced or repressed in specific conditions. Our results unravel several architectural features of yeast core promoters and suggest that the yeast core promoter sequence downstream of the TATA box (or of similar sequences involved in recruitment of the pre-initiation complex) is a major determinant of maximal promoter activity. We further show that human core promoters also contain features that are indicative of maximal promoter activity; thus, our results emphasize the important role of the core promoter sequence in transcriptional regulation.},

@article{Castrillo2007,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell growth underlies many key cellular and developmental processes, yet a limited number of studies have been carried out on cell-growth regulation. Comprehensive studies at the transcriptional, proteomic and metabolic levels under defined controlled conditions are currently lacking. RESULTS: Metabolic control analysis is being exploited in a systems biology study of the eukaryotic cell. Using chemostat culture, we have measured the impact of changes in flux (growth rate) on the transcriptome, proteome, endometabolome and exometabolome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each functional genomic level shows clear growth-rate-associated trends and discriminates between carbon-sufficient and carbon-limited conditions. Genes consistently and significantly upregulated with increasing growth rate are frequently essential and encode evolutionarily conserved proteins of known function that participate in many protein-protein interactions. In contrast, more unknown, and fewer essential, genes are downregulated with increasing growth rate; their protein products rarely interact with one another. A large proportion of yeast genes under positive growth-rate control share orthologs with other eukaryotes, including humans. Significantly, transcription of genes encoding components of the TOR complex (a major controller of eukaryotic cell growth) is not subject to growth-rate regulation. Moreover, integrative studies reveal the extent and importance of post-transcriptional control, patterns of control of metabolic fluxes at the level of enzyme synthesis, and the relevance of specific enzymatic reactions in the control of metabolic fluxes during cell growth. CONCLUSION: This work constitutes a first comprehensive systems biology study on growth-rate control in the eukaryotic cell. The results have direct implications for advanced studies on cell growth, in vivo regulation of metabolic fluxes for comprehensive metabolic engineering, and for the design of genome-scale systems biology models of the eukaryotic cell.},

  abstract = {Cells adapt to different conditions by altering a vast number of components, which is measurable using transcriptome analysis. Given that a cell undergoing steady growth is constrained to sustain each of its internal components, the abundance of all the components in the cell has to be roughly doubled during each cell division event. From this steady-growth constraint, expression of all genes is shown to change along a one-parameter curve in the state space in response to the environmental stress. This leads to a global relationship that governs the cellular state: By considering a relatively moderate change around a steady state, logarithmic changes in expression are shown to be proportional across all genes, upon alteration of stress strength, with the proportionality coefficient given by the change in the growth rate of the cell. This theory is confirmed by transcriptome analysis of Escherichia Coli in response to several stresses.},

  abstract = {The growth rate-dependent regulation of cell size, ribosomal content, and metabolic efficiency follows a common pattern in unicellular organisms: with increasing growth rates, cell size and ribosomal content increase and a shift to energetically inefficient metabolism takes place. The latter two phenomena are also observed in fast growing tumour cells and cell lines. These patterns suggest a fundamental principle of design. In biology such designs can often be understood as the result of the optimization of fitness. Here we show that in basic models of self-replicating systems these patterns are the consequence of maximizing the growth rate. Whereas most models of cellular growth consider a part of physiology, for instance only metabolism, the approach presented here integrates several subsystems to a complete self-replicating system. Such models can yield fundamentally different optimal strategies. In particular, it is shown how the shift in metabolic efficiency originates from a tradeoff between investments in enzyme synthesis and metabolic yields for alternative catabolic pathways. The models elucidate how the optimization of growth by natural selection shapes growth strategies.},

Elucidating these relations is important both for understanding the physiological functions of endogenous genetic circuits and for designing robust synthetic systems.

A theory incorporating these constraints can accurately predict how cell proliferation and gene expression affect one another, quantitatively accounting for the effect of translation-inhibiting antibiotics on gene expression and the effect of gratuitous protein expression on cell growth. The use of such empirical relations, analogous to phenomenological laws, may facilitate our understanding and manipulation of complex biological systems before underlying regulatory circuits are elucidated.},

@article{Regenberg2006,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growth rate is central to the development of cells in all organisms. However, little is known about the impact of changing growth rates. We used continuous cultures to control growth rate and studied the transcriptional program of the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with generation times varying between 2 and 35 hours. RESULTS: A total of 5930 transcripts were identified at the different growth rates studied. Consensus clustering of these revealed that half of all yeast genes are affected by the specific growth rate, and that the changes are similar to those found when cells are exposed to different types of stress (>80\% overlap). Genes with decreased transcript levels in response to faster growth are largely of unknown function (>50\%) whereas genes with increased transcript levels are involved in macromolecular biosynthesis such as those that encode ribosomal proteins. This group also covers most targets of the transcriptional activator RAP1, which is also known to be involved in replication. A positive correlation between the location of replication origins and the location of growth-regulated genes suggests a role for replication in growth rate regulation. CONCLUSION: Our data show that the cellular growth rate has great influence on transcriptional regulation. This, in turn, implies that one should be cautious when comparing mutants with different growth rates. Our findings also indicate that much of the regulation is coordinated via the chromosomal location of the affected genes, which may be valuable information for the control of heterologous gene expression in metabolic engineering.},

Here, we used accurate gene expression measurements from living cell cultures, bearing GFP reporters, to map in detail the input function of the classic lacZYA operon of Escherichia coli, as a function of about a hundred combinations of its two inducers, cAMP and isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG). We found an unexpectedly intricate function with four plateau levels and four thresholds. This result compares well with a mathematical model of the binding of the regulatory proteins cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and LacI to the lac regulatory region. The model is also used to demonstrate that with few mutations, the same region could encode much purer AND-like or even OR-like functions. This possibility means that the wild-type region is selected to perform an elaborate computation in setting the transcription rate. The present approach can be generally used to map the input functions of other genes.},

The two most widely used primary growth models are the Baranyi and Gompertz models. A three-phase linear model was developed to determine how well growth curves could be described using a simpler model. The model divides bacterial growth curves into three phases: the lag and stationary phases where the specific growth rate is zero (mu=0), and the exponential phase where the logarithm of the bacterial population increases linearly with time (mu=constant). The model has four parameters: N-0 (Log(10) of initial population density), NMAX (Log(10) of final population density), hac (time when lag phase ends), and tMax (time when exponential phase ends). A comparison of the linear model was made against the Baranyi and Gompertz models, using established growth data for Escherichia coil 0157:H7. The growth curves predicted by the three models showed good agreement. The linear model was more 'robust' than the others, especially when experimental data were minimal. The physiological assumptions underlying the linear model are discussed, with particular emphasis on assuring that the model is consistent with bacterial behavior both as individual cells and as populations. it is proposed that the transitional behavior of bacteria at the end of the lag phase can be explained on the basis of biological variability.

Overall, 90\% of the targeted proteins, including families of isoenzymes, were consistently detected and quantified in each sample, generating a proteomic data set that represents a nutritionally perturbed biological system at high reproducibility.

Here, we examine the connection between patterns of nucleosome occupancy and the capacity to modulate gene expression upon changing conditions, i.e., transcriptional plasticity. By analyzing genome-wide data of nucleosome positioning in yeast, we find that the presence of nucleosomes close to the transcription start site is associated with high transcriptional plasticity, while nucleosomes at more distant upstream positions are negatively correlated with transcriptional plasticity. Based on this, we identify two typical promoter structures associated with low or high plasticity, respectively. The first class is characterized by a relatively large nucleosome-free region close to the start site coupled with well-positioned nucleosomes further upstream, whereas the second class displays a more evenly distributed and dynamic nucleosome positioning, with high occupancy close to the start site. The two classes are further distinguished by multiple promoter features, including histone turnover, binding site locations, H2A.Z occupancy, expression noise, and expression diversity. Analysis of nucleosome positioning in human promoters reproduces the main observations. Our results suggest two distinct strategies for gene regulation by chromatin, which are selectively employed by different genes.},

A large set of genes (approximately 900) showed a similar drastic response to almost all of these environmental changes. Additional features of the genomic responses were specialized for specific conditions.

@article{Segre2002,
  abstract = {An important goal of whole-cell computational modeling is to integrate detailed biochemical information with biological intuition to produce testable predictions. Based on the premise that prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli have maximized their growth performance along evolution, flux balance analysis (FBA) predicts metabolic flux distributions at steady state by using linear programming. Corroborating earlier results, we show that recent intracellular flux data for wild-type E. coli JM101 display excellent agreement with FBA predictions. Although the assumption of optimality for a wild-type bacterium is justifiable, the same argument may not be valid for genetically engineered knockouts or other bacterial strains that were not exposed to long-term evolutionary pressure. We address this point by introducing the method of minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), whereby we test the hypothesis that knockout metabolic fluxes undergo a minimal redistribution with respect to the flux configuration of the wild type. MOMA employs quadratic programming to identify a point in flux space, which is closest to the wild-type point, compatibly with the gene deletion constraint. Comparing MOMA and FBA predictions to experimental flux data for E. coli pyruvate kinase mutant PB25, we find that MOMA displays a significantly higher correlation than FBA. Our method is further supported by experimental data for E. coli knockout growth rates. It can therefore be used for predicting the behavior of perturbed metabolic networks, whose growth performance is in general suboptimal. MOMA and its possible future extensions may be useful in understanding the evolutionary optimization of metabolism.},

@article{Dill2011a,
  abstract = {What are the physical limits to cell behavior? Often, the physical limitations can be dominated by the proteome, the cell's complement of proteins. We combine known protein sizes, stabilities, and rates of folding and diffusion, with the known protein-length distributions P(N) of proteomes (Escherichia coli, yeast, and worm), to formulate distributions and scaling relationships in order to address questions of cell physics. Why do mesophilic cells die around 50{\hspace{0.167em}}{\textdegree}C? How can the maximal growth-rate temperature (around 37{\hspace{0.167em}}{\textdegree}C) occur so close to the cell-death temperature? The model shows that the cell's death temperature coincides with a denaturation catastrophe of its proteome. The reason cells can function so well just a few degrees below their death temperature is because proteome denaturation is so cooperative. Why are cells so dense-packed with protein molecules (about 20\% by volume)? Cells are packed at a density that maximizes biochemical reaction rates. At lower densities, proteins collide too rarely. At higher densities, proteins diffuse too slowly through the crowded cell. What limits cell sizes and growth rates? Cell growth is limited by rates of protein synthesis, by the folding rates of its slowest proteins, and--for large cells--by the rates of its protein diffusion. Useful insights into cell physics may be obtainable from scaling laws that encapsulate information from protein knowledge bases.},

We also constructed hybrid transducing phages that carry the IacZ gene fused to the promoter for the rrnE operon or to the promoter for the spc r protein operon. The amounts of galactokinase (or beta-galactosidase) were analyzed in lysogens carrying these various transducing phages grown in several different growth media. The synthesis rate of galactokinase (or beta-galactosidase) from the fused rrn-gal (or rrn-lac) operon relative to the total protein synthesis rate increased with increasing growth rate, as expected from the transcriptional activity of rRNA operons. In contrast, the relative synthesis rate of galactokinase (or beta-galactosidase) from the operon fused to alpha or spc r protein promoter remained approximately constant with increasing growth rate. These results were interpreted to mean that the characteristic increase in the relative synthesis rate of r protein with increasing growth rate is determined not by transcription regulatory mechanisms, but by posttranscriptional mechanisms, which presumably involve the feedback inhibition of r protein mRNA translation by free r proteins.},

Here, we accurately measured activities of \~{}900 S. cerevisiae and \~{}1800 E. coli promoters using fluorescent reporters. We show that in both organisms 60-90\% of promoters change their expression between conditions by a constant global scaling factor that depends only on the conditions and not on the promoter's identity. Quantifying such global effects allows precise characterization of specific regulation-promoters deviating from the global scale line. These are organized into few functionally related groups that also adhere to scale lines and preserve their relative activities across conditions. Thus, only several scaling factors suffice to accurately describe genome-wide expression profiles across conditions. We present a parameter-free passive resource allocation model that quantitatively accounts for the global scaling factors. It suggests that many changes in expression across conditions result from global effects and not specific regulation, and provides means for quantitative interpretation of expression profiles.},

@article{Klumpp2008,
  abstract = {Physiological changes that result in changes in bacterial gene expression are often accompanied by changes in the growth rate for fast adapting enteric bacteria. Because the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells depends on the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of promoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration, which is difficult to quantify directly. Here, we develop a simple physical model describing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs transcribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs nonspecifically bound to DNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for Escherichia coli allow us to determine the 2 unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to predict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive (unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate-dependent regulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in transcription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene expression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP expression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the case of the stringent response after amino acid starvation, we can evaluate the plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control proposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and biosynthetic operons.},

Implicit in the value for some of these parameters is a specific macromolecular control system: the control of the growth rate ($\tau$), the timing of initiation of rounds of chromosome replication (P0), and the regulation of cell division (D). The utility of these relations is illustrated by using updated measurements of the macromolecular composition of E. coli B/r to calculate values for the fundamental parameters and to predict the composition of a mutant which has a defect in the control of DNA replication. Furthermore, the meaning of several often-cited physiological parameters (RNA/protein, RNA/cell and RNA/genome) is examined. The relations presented here show that these parameters and their variation with growth rate are not directly relevant to arguments about control of ribosome synthesis or culture growth.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that a significant component of expression variability arises from extrinsic factors thought to influence multiple genes simultaneously, yet the biological origins of this extrinsic variability have received little attention. Here we combine computational modelling with fluorescence data generated from multiple promoter-gene inserts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify two major sources of extrinsic variability. One unavoidable source arising from the coupling of gene expression with population dynamics leads to a ubiquitous lower limit for expression variability. A second source, which is modelled as originating from a common upstream transcription factor, exemplifies how regulatory networks can convert noise in upstream regulator expression into extrinsic noise at the output of a target gene. Our results highlight the importance of the interplay of gene regulatory networks with population heterogeneity for understanding the origins of cellular diversity.},

We argue that this correlation does not reflect a direct feedback from growth rate to gene expression. Rather, what appears to be a response to growth rate is dominated by environmental sensing. External parameters, such as nutrition or temperature, feed-forward to define gene expression pattern that is tuned to the evolutionary-predicted growth rate. While such a feed-forward strategy requires fine-tuning of signaling mechanisms, and is limited in the range of environments that can be monitored, it enables advanced preparation to physiological changes that predictably occur following environmental switching. The capacity to anticipate and prepare for changing conditions was probably a major selection force during yeast evolution.},

For a cell of bacterial size, diffusion limitation of glucose influx was negligible. Nevertheless, a significant concentration gradient for one of the enzyme species, nonphosphorylated IIA(Glc), was found. This should have consequences because the phosphorylation state of IIA(Glc) is an important intracellular signal. For mammalian cell sizes we found significant diffusion limitation, as well as strong concentration gradients in many PTS components, and strong effects on glucose and energy signaling. We calculated that the PTS may sense both extracellular glucose and the intracellular free-energy state. We discuss i), that the effects of diffusion on cell function should prevent this highly effective bacterial system from functioning in eukaryotic cells, ii), that in the larger eukaryotic cell any similar chain of mobile group-transfer proteins can neither sustain the same volumetric flux as in bacteria nor transmit a signal far into the cell, and iii), that systems such as these may exhibit spatial differentiation in their sensitivity to different signals.},

  abstract = {We studied the physiological response to limitation by diverse nutrients in batch and steady-state (chemostat) cultures of S. cerevisiae. We found that the global pattern of transcription in steady-state cultures in limiting phosphate or sulfate is essentially identical to that of batch cultures growing in the same medium just before the limiting nutrient is completely exhausted. The massive stress response and complete arrest of the cell cycle that occurs when nutrients are fully exhausted in batch cultures is not observed in the chemostat, indicating that the cells in the chemostat are poor, not starving. Similar comparisons using leucine or uracil auxotrophs limited on leucine or uracil again showed patterns of gene expression in steady-state closely resembling those of corresponding batch cultures just before they exhaust the nutrient. Although there is also a strong stress response in the auxotrophic batch cultures, cell cycle arrest, if it occurs at all, is much less uniform. Many of the differences among the patterns of gene expression between the four nutrient limitations are interpretable in light of known involvement of the genes in stress responses or in the regulation or execution of particular metabolic pathways appropriate to the limiting nutrient. We conclude that cells adjust their growth rate to nutrient availability and maintain homeostasis in the same way in batch and steady state conditions; cells in steady-state cultures are in a physiological condition normally encountered in batch cultures.},

The behavior of most of these proteins could be described by a relatively small number of patterns. 102 of the 140 proteins exhibited nearly linear variations with growth rate. The remaining 38 proteins exhibited levels which seemed to depend more on the chemical nature of the medium than on growth rate. Proteins, including the ribosomal proteins, that increase in amount with increasing growth rate account for 20\% of total cell protein by weight during growth on acetate, 32\% on glucose-minimal medium and 55\% on glucose-rich medium.

Although metabolism continuously adapts to unpredictable environmental changes, and although bistability was found in certain substrate-uptake pathways, central carbon metabolism is thought to operate deterministically. Here, we combine experiment and theory to demonstrate that a clonal Escherichia coli population splits into two stochastically generated phenotypic subpopulations after glucose-gluconeogenic substrate shifts. Most cells refrain from growth, entering a dormant persister state that manifests as a lag phase in the population growth curve. The subpopulation-generating mechanism resides at the metabolic core, overarches the metabolic and transcriptional networks, and only allows the growth of cells initially achieving sufficiently high gluconeogenic flux. Thus, central metabolism does not ensure the gluconeogenic growth of individual cells, but uses a population-level adaptation resulting in responsive diversification upon nutrient changes.},

  abstract = {A biological membrane is conceptualized as a system in which membrane proteins are naturally matched to the equilibrium thickness of the lipid bilayer. Cholesterol, in addition to lipid composition, has been suggested to be a major regulator of bilayer thickness in vivo because measurements in vitro have shown that cholesterol can increase the thickness of simple phospholipid/cholesterol bilayers. Using solution x-ray scattering, we have directly measured the average bilayer thickness of exocytic pathway membranes, which contain increasing amounts of cholesterol. The bilayer thickness of membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi, and the basolateral and apical plasma membranes, purified from rat hepatocytes, were determined to be 37.5 +/- 0.4 A, 39.5 +/- 0.4 A, 35.6 +/- 0.6 A, and 42.5 +/- 0.3 A, respectively. After cholesterol depletion using cyclodextrins, Golgi and apical plasma membranes retained their respective bilayer thicknesses whereas the bilayer thickness of the endoplasmic reticulum and the basolateral plasma membrane decreased by 1.0 A. Because cholesterol was shown to have a marginal effect on the thickness of these membranes, we measured whether membrane proteins could modulate thickness. Protein-depleted membranes demonstrated changes in thickness of up to 5 A, suggesting that (i) membrane proteins rather than cholesterol modulate the average bilayer thickness of eukaryotic cell membranes, and (ii) proteins and lipids are not naturally hydrophobically matched in some biological membranes. A marked effect of membrane proteins on the thickness of Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membranes, which do not contain cholesterol, was also observed, emphasizing the generality of our findings.},

Classical concepts in equilibrium thermodynamics-enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy of biochemical reaction systems-are generalized to nonequilibrium settings. Chemical motive force, heat dissipation rate, and entropy production (creation) rate, key concepts in nonequilibrium systems, are introduced. Dynamic equations for the thermodynamic quantities are presented in terms of the key observables of a biochemical network: stoichiometric matrix Q, reaction fluxes J, and chemical potentials of species mu without evoking empirical rate laws. Energy conservation and the Second Law are established for steady-state and dynamic biochemical networks. The theory provides the physiochemical basis for analyzing large-scale metabolic networks in living organisms.},

Despite the significant effect that Rubisco has on the fitness of plants and other photosynthetic organisms, this enzyme is known to have a low catalytic rate and a tendency to confuse its substrate, carbon dioxide, with oxygen. This apparent inefficiency is puzzling and raises questions regarding the roles of evolution versus biochemical constraints in shaping Rubisco. Here we examine these questions by analyzing the measured kinetic parameters of Rubisco from various organisms living in various environments. The analysis presented here suggests that the evolution of Rubisco is confined to an effectively one-dimensional landscape, which is manifested in simple power law correlations between its kinetic parameters. Within this one-dimensional landscape, which may represent biochemical and structural constraints, Rubisco appears to be tuned to the intracellular environment in which it resides such that the net photosynthesis rate is nearly optimal. Our analysis indicates that the specificity of Rubisco is not the main determinant of its efficiency but rather the trade-off between the carboxylation velocity and CO(2) affinity. As a result, the presence of oxygen has only a moderate effect on the optimal performance of Rubisco, which is determined mostly by the local CO(2) concentration. Rubisco appears as an experimentally testable example for the evolution of proteins subject both to strong selection pressure and to biochemical constraints that strongly confine the evolutionary plasticity to a low-dimensional landscape.},

  abstract = {Central carbon metabolism uses a complex series of enzymatic steps to convert sugars into metabolic precursors. These precursors are then used to generate the entire biomass of the cell. Are there simplifying principles that can explain the structure of such metabolic networks? Here we address this question by studying central carbon metabolism in E. coli. We use all known classes of enzymes that work on carbohydrates to generate rules for converting compounds and for generating possible paths between compounds. We find that central carbon metabolism is built as a minimal walk between the 12 precursor metabolites that form the basis for biomass and one precursor essential for the positive net ATP balance in glycolysis: every pair of consecutive precursors in the network is connected by the minimal number of enzymatic steps. Similarly, input sugars are converted into precursors by the shortest possible enzymatic paths. This suggests an optimality principle for the structure of central carbon metabolism. The present approach may be used to study other metabolic networks and to design new minimal pathways.},

@article{Clarens2010,
  abstract = {Algae are an attractive source of biomass energy since they do not compete with food crops and have higher energy yields per area than terrestrial crops. In spite of these advantages, algae cultivation has not yet been compared with conventional crops from a life cycle perspective. In this work, the impacts associated with algae production were determined using a stochastic life cycle model and compared with switchgrass, canola, and corn farming. The results indicate that these conventional crops have lower environmental impacts than algae in energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and water regardless of cultivation location. Only in total land use and eutrophication potential do algae perform favorably. The large environmental footprint of algae cultivation is driven predominantly by upstream impacts, such as the demand for CO(2) and fertilizer. To reduce these impacts, flue gas and, to a greater extent, wastewater could be used to offset most of the environmental burdens associated with algae. To demonstrate the benefits of algae production coupled with wastewater treatment, the model was expanded to include three different municipal wastewater effluents as sources of nitrogen and phosphorus. Each provided a significant reduction in the burdens of algae cultivation, and the use of source-separated urine was found to make algae more environmentally beneficial than the terrestrial crops.},

Here, however, we observe chance effects during range expansions that dramatically alter the gene pool even in large microbial populations. Initially well mixed populations of two fluorescently labeled strains of Escherichia coli develop well defined, sector-like regions with fractal boundaries in expanding colonies. The formation of these regions is driven by random fluctuations that originate in a thin band of pioneers at the expanding frontier. A comparison of bacterial and yeast colonies (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) suggests that this large-scale genetic sectoring is a generic phenomenon that may provide a detectable footprint of past range expansions.},

In this work, we reassessed earlier results by digitizing carbon atomic traces in metabolic reactions annotated for Escherichia coli. Our analysis revealed that the average path length of its metabolism is much longer than previously thought and that the metabolic world of this organism is not small in terms of biosynthesis and degradation.},

The remaining pathways, identified by elementary mode analysis, consist of four pathways with non-growth-associated conversion of pentoses and hexoses into ethanol at theoretical yields and two pathways with tight coupling of anaerobic cell growth with ethanol formation at high yields. Elimination of three additional genes resulted in a strain that selectively grows only on pentoses, even in the presence of glucose, with a high ethanol yield. We showed that the ethanol yields of strains with minimized metabolic functionality closely matched the theoretical predictions. Remarkably, catabolite repression was completely absent during anaerobic growth, resulting in the simultaneous utilization of pentoses and hexoses for ethanol production.},

This raises the question of why a particular circuit architecture is selected to implement a given cellular process. To investigate this problem, we compared the Bacillus subtilis circuit that regulates differentiation into the competence state to an engineered circuit with an alternative architecture (SynEx) in silico and in vivo. Time-lapse microscopy measurements showed that SynEx cells generated competence dynamics similar to native cells and reconstituted the physiology of differentiation. However, architectural differences between the circuits altered the dynamic distribution of stochastic fluctuations (noise) during circuit operation. This distinction in noise causes functional differences between the circuits by selectively controlling the timing of competence episodes and response of the system to various DNA concentrations. These results reveal a tradeoff between temporal precision and physiological response range that is controlled by distinct noise characteristics of alternative circuit architectures.},

@article{Sauer2004,
  abstract = {Pentose phosphate pathway and isocitrate dehydrogenase are generally considered to be the major sources of the anabolic reductant NADPH. As one of very few microbes, Escherichia coli contains two transhydrogenase isoforms with unknown physiological function that could potentially transfer electrons directly from NADH to NADP+ and vice versa. Using defined mutants and metabolic flux analysis, we identified the proton-translocating transhydrogenase PntAB as a major source of NADPH in E. coli. During standard aerobic batch growth on glucose, 35-45\% of the NADPH that is required for biosynthesis was produced via PntAB, whereas pentose phosphate pathway and isocitrate dehydrogenase contributed 35-45\% and 20-25\%, respectively. The energy-independent transhydrogenase UdhA, in contrast, was essential for growth under metabolic conditions with excess NADPH formation, i.e. growth on acetate or in a phosphoglucose isomerase mutant that catabolized glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway. Thus, both isoforms have divergent physiological functions: energy-dependent reduction of NADP+ with NADH by PntAB and reoxidation of NADPH by UdhA. Expression appeared to be modulated by the redox state of cellular metabolism, because genetic and environmental manipulations that increased or decreased NADPH formation down-regulated pntA or udhA transcription, respectively. The two transhydrogenase isoforms provide E. coli primary metabolism with an extraordinary flexibility to cope with varying catabolic and anabolic demands, which raises two general questions: why do only a few bacteria contain both isoforms, and how do other organisms manage NADPH metabolism?},

@article{Heinrich1997,
  abstract = {It is analyzed whether the structural design of contemporary glycolysis can be explained theoretically on the basis of optimization principles originating from natural selection during evolution. Particular attention is paid to the problem of how the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the glycolytic pathway are related to its stoichiometry with respect to the number and location of ATP-coupling sites. The mathematical analysis of a minimal model of unbranched energy-converting pathways shows that the requirement of high ATP-production rate favours a structural design that includes not only ATP-producing reactions (P-sites) but also ATP-consuming reactions (C-sites). It is demonstrated that, at fixed overall thermodynamic properties of a chain, the ATP-production rate may be enhanced by kinetic optimization. The ATP-production rate is increased if the C-sites are concentrated at the beginning and all the P-sites at the end of the pathway. An optimum is attained, which is characterized by numbers of coupling sites corresponding to those found in glycolysis. Various extensions of the minimal model are considered, which allow the effects of internal feedback-regulations, variable enzyme concentrations, and the symmetric branching of glycolysis at the aldolase step to be considered.},

These calculations are more difficult than the calculation of transformed thermodynamic properties from species properties, and they are an application of the inverse Legendre transform. The Delta(f)G degrees values of species of a reactant can be calculated from an apparent equilibrium constant if the Delta(f)G degrees values are known for all the species of all the other reactants and the pKs of the reactant of interest are known. The Delta(f)H degrees of species of a reactant can be calculated from the heat of reaction if the Delta(f)H degrees values are known for all species of the other reactants and Delta(f)G degrees values are known for all species in the reaction. The standard enthalpies of acid dissociation of the reactant of interest are also needed. The inverse Legendre transformation is accomplished by using computer programs to set up the simultaneous equations that involve the Delta(f)H degrees of the species and solving them. Thirty two new species matrixes providing Delta(f)G degrees values and eight new species matrixes providing Delta(f)H degrees values are calculated. It is the specificity and speed of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that make it possible to determine standard thermodynamic properties of complicated species in aqueous solution that could never have been obtained classically.},

Network-embedded thermodynamic analysis (NET analysis) is presented as a framework for mechanistic and model-based analysis of these data. By coupling the data to an operating metabolic network via the second law of thermodynamics and the metabolites' Gibbs energies of formation, NET analysis allows inferring functional principles from quantitative metabolite data; for example it identifies reactions that are subject to active allosteric or genetic regulation as exemplified with quantitative metabolite data from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, the optimization framework of NET analysis was demonstrated to be a valuable tool to systematically investigate data sets for consistency, for the extension of sub-omic metabolome data sets and for resolving intracompartmental concentrations from cell-averaged metabolome data. Without requiring any kind of kinetic modeling, NET analysis represents a perfectly scalable and unbiased approach to uncover insights from quantitative metabolome data.},

  abstract = {The stoichiometry of ATP-producing metabolic pathways had been analysed theoretically by several authors by using evolutionary arguments and optimality principles. Waddell et al. (Biochem Educ 27:12-13, 1999) analysed (lactate-producing) glycolysis and used linear irreversible thermodynamics. The result was that half of the free-energy difference should be converted into free-energy of ATP and the remaining half should be used to drive the pathway. The calculated stoichiometry is in agreement with the observed yield of two moles of ATP per mole of glucose. Using the same approach, we here analyse eight other metabolic pathways. Although the deviation is not very large, the calculated values do not fit as nicely as for glycolysis as leading to lactate. For example, for O{} respiration, the theoretical ATP yield equals 27.9. The real value varies among organisms between 26 and 38. For mixed-acid fermentation in Escherichia coli, the theoretical and experimental values are 2.24 and 2, respectively. For arginine degradation in M. pneumoniae, the calculated value is 2.43 mol of ATP, while in vivo only one mole is produced. During evolution, some pathways may not have reached their optimal ATP net production because energy yield is not their only function. Moreover, it should be acknowledged that the approach by linear irreversible thermodynamics is a rough approximation.},

Here, we investigate the origin of these growth laws by analyzing the features of ribosomal regulation that coordinate proteome-wide expression changes with cell growth in a variety of nutrient conditions in the model organism Escherichia coli. We identify supply-driven feedforward activation of ribosomal protein synthesis as the key regulatory motif maximizing amino acid flux, and autonomously guiding a cell to achieve optimal growth in different environments. The growth laws emerge naturally from the robust regulatory strategy underlying growth rate control, irrespective of the details of the molecular implementation. The study highlights the interplay between phenomenological modeling and molecular mechanisms in uncovering fundamental operating constraints, with implications for endogenous and synthetic design of microorganisms.},

Herein we report what are to our knowledge the first direct biocatalytic routes to BDO from renewable carbohydrate feedstocks, leading to a strain of Escherichia coli capable of producing 18 g l(-1) of this highly reduced, non-natural chemical. A pathway-identification algorithm elucidated multiple pathways for the biosynthesis of BDO from common metabolic intermediates. Guided by a genome-scale metabolic model, we engineered the E. coli host to enhance anaerobic operation of the oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle, thereby generating reducing power to drive the BDO pathway. The organism produced BDO from glucose, xylose, sucrose and biomass-derived mixed sugar streams. This work demonstrates a systems-based metabolic engineering approach to strain design and development that can enable new bioprocesses for commodity chemicals that are not naturally produced by living cells.},

@article{Klamt2002a,
  abstract = {Metabolite balancing has turned out to be a powerful computational tool in metabolic engineering. However, the linear equation systems occurring in this analysis are often underdetermined. If it is difficult or impossible to find the missing constraints, it is nevertheless feasible in some cases to determine the values of a subset of the unknown rates. Here, a procedure for finding out which reaction rates can be uniquely calculated in underdetermined metabolic networks and computing these rates is given. The method is based on the null space to the stoichiometry matrix corresponding to the reactions with unknown rates. It is shown that this method is considerably easier to handle than an algorithm given previously (Van der Heijden et al., 1994a). Furthermore, a useful elementary representation of the null space is presented which is closely related with the elementary flux modes. This unique representation is central to a more general approach to observability/calculability analysis. In particular, it allows one to find, in an easy way, those sets of measurable rates that enable a calculation of a certain unknown rate. Besides, rates which are never calculable by metabolite balancing may be easily detected by this method. The applicability of these methods is illustrated by a model of the central metabolism in purple nonsulfur bacteria. The photoheterotrophic growth of these representatives of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria is stoichiometrically analyzed. Interesting metabolic constraints caused by the necessary balancing of NADPH can be detected in a highly underdetermined system. This is, to our knowledge, the first application of stoichiometric analysis to the metabolic network in this bacteria group using metabolite balancing techniques. A new software tool, the FluxAnalyzer, is introduced. It allows quantitative and structural analysis of metabolic networks in a graphical user interface.},

@article{Summers2013,
  abstract = {ABSTRACT Fe(II)-oxidizing aerobic bacteria are poorly understood, due in part to the difficulties involved in laboratory cultivation. Specific challenges include (i) providing a steady supply of electrons as Fe(II) while (ii) managing rapid formation of insoluble Fe(III) oxide precipitates and (iii) maintaining oxygen concentrations in the micromolar range to minimize abiotic Fe(II) oxidation. Electrochemical approaches offer an opportunity to study bacteria that require problematic electron donors or acceptors in their respiration. In the case of Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria, if the electron transport machinery is able to oxidize metals at the outer cell surface, electrodes poised at potentials near those of natural substrates could serve as electron donors, eliminating concentration issues, side reactions, and mineral end products associated with metal oxidation. To test this hypothesis, the marine isolate Mariprofundus ferrooxydans PV-1, a neutrophilic obligate Fe(II)-oxidizing autotroph, was cultured using a poised electrode as the sole energy source. When cells grown in Fe(II)-containing medium were transferred into a three-electrode electrochemical cell, a cathodic (negative) current representing electron uptake by bacteria was detected, and it increased over a period of weeks. Cultures scraped from a portion of the electrode and transferred into sterile reactors consumed electrons at a similar rate. After three transfers in the absence of Fe(II), electrode-grown biofilms were studied to determine the relationship between donor redox potential and respiration rate. Electron microscopy revealed that under these conditions, M. ferrooxydans PV-1 attaches to electrodes and does not produce characteristic iron oxide stalks but still appears to exhibit bifurcate cell division. IMPORTANCE Electrochemical cultivation, supporting growth of bacteria with a constant supply of electron donors or acceptors, is a promising tool for studying lithotrophic species in the laboratory. Major pitfalls present in standard cultivation methods used for metal-oxidizing microbes can be avoided by the use of an electrode as the sole electron donor. Electrochemical cultivation also offers a window into the poorly understood metabolism of microbes such as obligate Fe(II), Mn(II), or S(0) oxidizers by replacing the electron source with the controlled surface of an electrode. The elucidation of redox-dependent behavior of these microbes could enhance industrial applications tuned to oxidation of specific metals, provide insight into how bacteria evolved to compete with oxygen for reactive metal species, and model geochemical impacts of their metabolism in the environment.},

@article{Jackson2002,
  abstract = {Many fermentative bacteria obtain energy for growth by reactions in which the change in free energy (DeltaG') is less than that needed to synthesize ATP. These bacteria couple substrate metabolism directly to ATP synthesis, however, by classical phosphoryl transfer reactions. An explanation for the energy economy of these organisms is that biological systems conserve energy in discrete amounts, with a minimum, biochemically convertible energy value of about -20 kJ mol-1 (refs 1, 2, 3). This concept predicts that anaerobic substrate decay ceases before the minimum free energy value is reached, and several studies support this prediction. Here we show that metabolism by syntrophic associations, in which the degradation of a substrate by one species is thermodynamically possible only through removal of the end product by another species, can occur at values close to thermodynamic equilibrium (DeltaG' approximately 0 kJ mol-1). The free energy remaining when substrate metabolism halts is not constant; it depends on the terminal electron-accepting reaction and the amount of energy required for substrate activation. Syntrophic associations metabolize near thermodynamic equilibrium, indicating that bacteria operate extremely efficient catabolic systems.},

@article{Wang2009,
  abstract = {The breadth of genomic diversity found among organisms in nature allows populations to adapt to diverse environments. However, genomic diversity is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new phenotypes do not easily arise on practical timescales. Although in vitro and directed evolution methods have created genetic variants with usefully altered phenotypes, these methods are limited to laborious and serial manipulation of single genes and are not used for parallel and continuous directed evolution of gene networks or genomes. Here, we describe multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. MAGE simultaneously targets many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices that automate the MAGE technology to facilitate rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions, deletions). We applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Twenty-four genetic components in the DXP pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic DNA, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day. We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene production within 3 days, a significant improvement over existing metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting the design and evolution of organisms with new and improved properties.},

@article{Schuetz2007,
  abstract = {To which extent can optimality principles describe the operation of metabolic networks? By explicitly considering experimental errors and in silico alternate optima in flux balance analysis, we systematically evaluate the capacity of 11 objective functions combined with eight adjustable constraints to predict (13)C-determined in vivo fluxes in Escherichia coli under six environmental conditions. While no single objective describes the flux states under all conditions, we identified two sets of objectives for biologically meaningful predictions without the need for further, potentially artificial constraints. Unlimited growth on glucose in oxygen or nitrate respiring batch cultures is best described by nonlinear maximization of the ATP yield per flux unit. Under nutrient scarcity in continuous cultures, in contrast, linear maximization of the overall ATP or biomass yields achieved the highest predictive accuracy. Since these particular objectives predict the system behavior without preconditioning of the network structure, the identified optimality principles reflect, to some extent, the evolutionary selection of metabolic network regulation that realizes the various flux states.},

@article{Aye2010,
  abstract = {The largest component of the human heart, the left ventricle (LV), plays a major role in delivering blood throughout the body. Therefore, an in-depth detailed quantitative proteome analysis of the human LV is a valuable resource. For this purpose, a multifaceted proteomics approach combining differential sample fractionations (gel, strong cation exchange (SCX)), enzymatic digestions (trypsin, chymotrypsin, LysN), and peptide fragmentation techniques (CID and ETcaD) was used to enhance protein sequence coverage, identification confidence and quantitative abundance determination. Using stringent criteria, 3584 distinct proteins could be identified from the latest well-annotated Swissprot database (23,000 entries). Commutatively, the over 130,000 identified MS/MS spectra were used to assess concentrations of each identified LV protein through a combination of spectral counting methods. Among the most concentrated proteins, many currently used biomarkers for detection of myocardial infarction reside. These cardiac leakage markers have a good diagnostic power, but their prognostic potential seems limited. Discovery of markers that represent etiological determinants of cardiac disease require a shift of focus towards the signaling proteome. Therefore, a protein-class centered quantitative analysis of kinases, phosphatases and GTPases was adopted. These comparative analyses revealed many cardiac involved kinases (PKA, CaMKII, ERK) to reside among the most abundant signaling proteins, and also to mediate many observed in vivo phosphorylation sites. The abundance chart of signaling proteins may assist in identifying novel functional pathways, for instance through the abundant, but relatively little known, kinases STK38L and OXSR1. The obtained quantitative protein library of the human left ventricle is a valuable resource to isolate signaling based, putative biomarkers with concentrations likely to be detectable in plasma.},

@article{Ross2011,
  abstract = {Bioelectrochemical systems rely on microorganisms to link complex oxidation/reduction reactions to electrodes. For example, in Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1, an electron transfer conduit consisting of cytochromes and structural proteins, known as the Mtr respiratory pathway, catalyzes electron flow from cytoplasmic oxidative reactions to electrodes. Reversing this electron flow to drive microbial reductive metabolism offers a possible route for electrosynthesis of high value fuels and chemicals. We examined electron flow from electrodes into Shewanella to determine the feasibility of this process, the molecular components of reductive electron flow, and what driving forces were required. Addition of fumarate to a film of S. oneidensis adhering to a graphite electrode poised at -0.36 V versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) immediately led to electron uptake, while a mutant lacking the periplasmic fumarate reductase FccA was unable to utilize electrodes for fumarate reduction. Deletion of the gene encoding the outer membrane cytochrome-anchoring protein MtrB eliminated 88\% of fumarate reduction. A mutant lacking the periplasmic cytochrome MtrA demonstrated more severe defects. Surprisingly, disruption of menC, which prevents menaquinone biosynthesis, eliminated 85\% of electron flux. Deletion of the gene encoding the quinone-linked cytochrome CymA had a similar negative effect, which showed that electrons primarily flowed from outer membrane cytochromes into the quinone pool, and back to periplasmic FccA. Soluble redox mediators only partially restored electron transfer in mutants, suggesting that soluble shuttles could not replace periplasmic protein-protein interactions. This work demonstrates that the Mtr pathway can power reductive reactions, shows this conduit is functionally reversible, and provides new evidence for distinct CymA:MtrA and CymA:FccA respiratory units.},

  abstract = {Genetic circuits that regulate distinct cellular processes can differ in their wiring pattern of interactions (architecture) and susceptibility to stochastic fluctuations (noise). Whether the link between circuit architecture and noise is of biological importance remains, however, poorly understood. To investigate this problem, we performed a computational study of gene expression noise for all possible circuit architectures of feed-forward loop (FFL) motifs. Results revealed that FFL architectures fall into two categories depending on whether their ON (stimulated) or OFF (unstimulated) steady states exhibit noise. To explore the biological importance of this difference in noise behavior, we analyzed 858 documented FFLs in Escherichia coli that were divided into 39 functional categories. The majority of FFLs were found to regulate two subsets of functional categories. Interestingly, these two functional categories associated with FFLs of opposite noise behaviors. This opposite noise preference revealed two noise-based strategies to cope with environmental constraints where cellular responses are either initiated or terminated stochastically to allow probabilistic sampling of alternative states. FFLs may thus be selected for their architecture-dependent noise behavior, revealing a biological role for noise that is encoded in gene circuit architectures.},

  abstract = {To what extent can modes of gene regulation be explained by systems-level properties of metabolic networks? Prior studies on co-regulation of metabolic genes have mainly focused on graph-theoretical features of metabolic networks and demonstrated a decreasing level of co-expression with increasing network distance, a na\"{\i}ve, but widely used, topological index. Others have suggested that static graph representations can poorly capture dynamic functional associations, e.g., in the form of dependence of metabolic fluxes across genes in the network. Here, we systematically tested the relative importance of metabolic flux coupling and network position on gene co-regulation, using a genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli. After validating the computational method with empirical data on flux correlations, we confirm that genes coupled by their enzymatic fluxes not only show similar expression patterns, but also share transcriptional regulators and frequently reside in the same operon. In contrast, we demonstrate that network distance per se has relatively minor influence on gene co-regulation. Moreover, the type of flux coupling can explain refined properties of the regulatory network that are ignored by simple graph-theoretical indices. Our results underline the importance of studying functional states of cellular networks to define physiologically relevant associations between genes and should stimulate future developments of novel functional genomic tools.},

@article{Boyle2011,
  abstract = {With rising energy prices and concern over the environmental impact of fossil fuel consumption, the push to develop biomass derived fuels has increased significantly. Although most global carbon fixation occurs via the Calvin Benson Bassham cycle, there are currently five other known pathways for carbon fixation; the goal of this study was to determine the thermodynamic efficiencies of all six carbon fixation pathways for the production of biomass using flux balance analysis. The three chemotrophic pathways, the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle and the dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle, were found to be more efficient than photoautotrophic carbon fixation pathways. However, as hydrogen is not freely available, the energetic cost of hydrogen production from sunlight was calculated and included in the overall energy demand, which results in a 5 fold increase in the energy demand of chemoautotrophic carbon fixation. Therefore, when the cost of hydrogen production is included, photoautotrophic pathways are more efficient. However, the energetic cost for the production of 12 metabolic precursors was found to vary widely across the different carbon fixation pathways; therefore, different pathways may be more efficient at producing products from a single precursor than others. The results of this study have significant impact on the selection or design of autotrophic organisms for biofuel or biochemical production. Overall biomass production from solar energy is most efficient in organisms using the reductive TCA cycle, however, products derived from one metabolic precursor may be more efficiently produced using other carbon fixation pathways.},

Despite being large and electronically insulating through most of their volume, some enzymes, when attached to an electrode, catalyze electrochemical reactions that are otherwise extremely sluggish (even with the best synthetic catalysts) and require a large overpotential to achieve a useful rate. These enzymes produce high electrocatalytic currents, displayed in single bidirectional voltammetric waves that switch direction (between oxidation and reduction) sharply at the equilibrium potential for the substrate redox couple. Notoriously irreversible processes such as CO(2) reduction are thereby rendered electrochemically reversible--a consequence of molecular evolution responding to stringent biological drivers for thermodynamic efficiency. Enzymes thus set high standards for the catalysts of future energy technologies.},

@article{Falkowski2008,
  abstract = {The biogeochemical cycles of H, C, N, O and S are coupled via biologically catalysed electron transfer (redox) reactions. The metabolic processes responsible for maintaining these cycles evolved over the first ca 2.3 Ga of Earth's history in prokaryotes and, through a sequence of events, led to the production of oxygen via the photobiologically catalysed oxidation of water. However, geochemical evidence suggests that there was a delay of several hundred million years before oxygen accumulated in Earth's atmosphere related to changes in the burial efficiency of organic matter and fundamental alterations in the nitrogen cycle. In the latter case, the presence of free molecular oxygen allowed ammonium to be oxidized to nitrate and subsequently denitrified. The interaction between the oxygen and nitrogen cycles in particular led to a negative feedback, in which increased production of oxygen led to decreased fixed inorganic nitrogen in the oceans. This feedback, which is supported by isotopic analyses of fixed nitrogen in sedimentary rocks from the Late Archaean, continues to the present. However, once sufficient oxygen accumulated in Earth's atmosphere to allow nitrification to out-compete denitrification, a new stable electron 'market' emerged in which oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration ultimately spread via endosymbiotic events and massive lateral gene transfer to eukaryotic host cells, allowing the evolution of complex (i.e. animal) life forms. The resulting network of electron transfers led a gas composition of Earth's atmosphere that is far from thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e. it is an emergent property), yet is relatively stable on geological time scales. The early coevolution of the C, N and O cycles, and the resulting non-equilibrium gaseous by-products can be used as a guide to search for the presence of life on terrestrial planets outside of our Solar System.},

Here we use LC-MS/MS to quantify more than 100 metabolite concentrations in aerobic, exponentially growing Escherichia coli with glucose, glycerol or acetate as the carbon source. The total observed intracellular metabolite pool was approximately 300 mM. A small number of metabolites dominate the metabolome on a molar basis, with glutamate being the most abundant. Metabolite concentration exceeds K(m) for most substrate-enzyme pairs. An exception is lower glycolysis, where concentrations of intermediates are near the K(m) of their consuming enzymes and all reactions are near equilibrium. This may facilitate efficient flux reversibility given thermodynamic and osmotic constraints. The data and analyses presented here highlight the ability to identify organizing metabolic principles from systems-level absolute metabolite concentration data.},

  abstract = {Complete oxidation of carbohydrates to CO2 is considered to be the exclusive property of the ubiquitous tricarboxylic acid cycle, the central process in cellular energy metabolism of aerobic organisms. Based on metabolism-wide in vivo quantification of intracellular carbon fluxes, we describe here complete oxidation of carbohydrates via the novel P-enolpyruvate (PEP)-glyoxylate cycle, in which two PEP molecules are oxidized by means of acetyl coenzyme A, citrate, glyoxylate, and oxaloacetate to CO2, and one PEP is regenerated. Key reactions are the constituents of the glyoxylate shunt and PEP carboxykinase, whose conjoint operation in this bi-functional catabolic and anabolic cycle is in sharp contrast to their generally recognized functions in anaplerosis and gluconeogenesis, respectively. Parallel operation of the PEP-glyoxylate cycle and the tricarboxylic acid cycle was identified in the bacterium Escherichia coli under conditions of glucose hunger in a slow-growing continuous culture. Because the PEP-glyoxylate cycle was also active in glucose excess batch cultures of an NADPH-overproducing phosphoglucose isomerase mutant, one function of this new central pathway may be the decoupling of catabolism from NADPH formation that would otherwise occur in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.},

@article{VanderHeijden1994,
  abstract = {Measurements provide the basis for process monitoring and control as well as for model development and validation. Systematic approaches to increase the accuracy and credibility of the empirical data set are therefore of great value. In (bio)chemical conversions, linear conservation relations such as the balance equations for charge, enthalpy, and/or chemical elements, can be employed to relate conversion rates. In a pactical situation, some of these rates will be measured (in effect, be calculated directly from primary measurements of, e.g., concentrations and flow rates), as others can or cannot be calculated from the measured ones. When certain measured rates can also be calculated from other measured rates, the set of equations, the accuracy and credibility of the measured rates can indeed be improved by, respectively, balancing and gross error diagnosis. The balanced conversion rates are more accurate, and form a consistent set of data, which is more suitable for further application (e.g., to calculate nonmeasured rates) than the raw measurements. Such an approach has drawn attention in previous studies. The current study deals mainly with the problem of mathematically classifying the conversion rates into balanceable and calculable rates, given the subset of measured rates. The significance of this problem is illustrated with some examples. It is shown that a simple matrix equation can be derived that contains the vector of measured conversion rates and the redundancy matrix R. Matrix R plays a predominant role in the classification problem. In supplementary articles, significance of the redundancy matrix R for an improved gross error diagnosis approach will be shown. In addition, efficient equations have been derived to calculate the balanceable and/or calculable rates. The method is completely based on matrix algebra (principally different from the graph-theoretical approach), and it is easily implemented into a computer program. (c) 1994 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Chemical equations are normally written in terms of specific ionic and elemental species and balance atoms of elements and electric charge. However, in a biochemical context it is usually better to write them with ionic reactants expressed as totals of species in equilibrium with each other. This implies that atoms of elements assumed to be at fixed concentrations, such as hydrogen at a specified pH, should not be balanced in a biochemical equation used for thermodynamic analysis. However, both kinds of equations are needed in biochemistry. The apparent equilibrium constant K' for a biochemical reaction is written in terms of such sums of species and can be used to calculate standard transformed Gibbs energies of reaction $\Delta$(r)G'{\textdegree}. This property for a biochemical reaction can be calculated from the standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation $\Delta$(f)G(i)'{\textdegree} of reactants, which can be calculated from the standard Gibbs energies of formation of species $\Delta$(f)G(j){\textdegree} and measured apparent equilibrium constants of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Tables of $\Delta$(r)G'{\textdegree} of reactions and $\Delta$(f)G(i)'{\textdegree} of reactants as functions of pH and temperature are available on the web, as are functions for calculating these properties. Biochemical thermodynamics is also important in enzyme kinetics because apparent equilibrium constant K' can be calculated from experimentally determined kinetic parameters when initial velocities have been determined for both forward and reverse reactions. Specific recommendations are made for reporting experimental results in the literature.},

Despite recent advances in experimental techniques, such information is limited and existing experimental data show extensive variation and they are based on in vitro experiments. In this article, we present a computational framework based on the well-established (log)linear formalism of metabolic control analysis. The framework employs a Monte Carlo sampling procedure to simulate the uncertainty in the kinetic data and applies statistical tools for the identification of the rate-limiting steps in metabolic networks. We applied the proposed framework to a branched biosynthetic pathway and the yeast glycolysis pathway. Analysis of the results allowed us to interpret and predict the responses of metabolic networks to genetic and environmental changes, and to gain insights on how uncertainty in the kinetic mechanisms and kinetic parameters propagate into the uncertainty in predicting network responses. Some of the practical applications of the proposed approach include the identification of drug targets for metabolic diseases and the guidance for design strategies in metabolic engineering for the purposeful manipulation of the metabolism of industrial organisms.},

  abstract = {Decarboxylation of orotidine 5'-monophosphate (Omp) to uridine 5'-monophosphate by orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ODCase) is currently the object of vivid debate. Here, we clarify its enzymatic activity with long time scale classical molecular dynamics and hybrid ab initio Car-Parrinello/molecular mechanics simulations. The lack of structural (experimental) information on the ground state of ODCase/Omp complex is overcome by a careful construction of the model and the analysis of three different strains of the enzyme. We find that the ODCase/substrate complex is characterized by a very stable charged network Omp-Lys-Asp-Lys-Asp, which is incompatible with the previously proposed direct decarboxylation driven by a ground-state destabilization. A direct decarboxylation induced by a transition-state electrostatic stabilization is consistent with our findings. The calculated activation free energy for the direct decarboxylation with the formation of a C6 carboanionic intermediate yields an overall rate enhancement by the enzyme (k(cat)/k(wat) = 3.5 x 10(16)) in agreement with experiments (k(cat)/k(wat) = 1.7 x 10(17)).

  abstract = {Cells must balance the cost and benefit of protein expression to optimize organismal fitness. The lac operon of the bacterium Escherichia coli has been a model for quantifying the physiological impact of costly protein production and for elucidating the resulting regulatory mechanisms. We report quantitative fitness measurements in 27 redesigned operons that suggested that protein production is not the primary origin of fitness costs. Instead, we discovered that the lac permease activity, which relates linearly to cost, is the major physiological burden to the cell. These findings explain control points in the lac operon that minimize the cost of lac permease activity, not protein expression. Characterizing similar relationships in other systems will be important to map the impact of cost/benefit tradeoffs on cell physiology and regulation.},

  abstract = {Sequencing of bacterial and archaeal genomes has revolutionized our understanding of the many roles played by microorganisms. There are now nearly 1,000 completed bacterial and archaeal genomes available, most of which were chosen for sequencing on the basis of their physiology. As a result, the perspective provided by the currently available genomes is limited by a highly biased phylogenetic distribution. To explore the value added by choosing microbial genomes for sequencing on the basis of their evolutionary relationships, we have sequenced and analysed the genomes of 56 culturable species of Bacteria and Archaea selected to maximize phylogenetic coverage. Analysis of these genomes demonstrated pronounced benefits (compared to an equivalent set of genomes randomly selected from the existing database) in diverse areas including the reconstruction of phylogenetic history, the discovery of new protein families and biological properties, and the prediction of functions for known genes from other organisms. Our results strongly support the need for systematic 'phylogenomic' efforts to compile a phylogeny-driven 'Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea' in order to derive maximum knowledge from existing microbial genome data as well as from genome sequences to come.},

In order to predict which of the possible fluxes are present under certain conditions, additional constraints and optimization principles can be applied. One approach of calculating unknown fluxes (frequently called flux balance analysis) is based on the optimality principle of maximizing the molar yield of biotransformations. Here, the relevance and applicability of that approach are examined, and it is compared with the principle of maximizing pathway flux. We discuss diverse experimental evidence showing that, often, those biochemical pathways are operative that allow fast but low-yield synthesis of important products, such as fermentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and several other yeast species. Together with arguments based on evolutionary game theory, this leads us to the conclusion that maximization of molar yield is by no means a universal principle.},

@article{Vojinovic2009,
  abstract = {Thermodynamic feasibility analysis (TFA) has been used as a tool capable of providing additional constraints to the mass balance-based methods of analysis of metabolic networks (e.g., flux balance analysis). Several publications have recently appeared in which TFA of different metabolic pathways from relatively simple to the genome-scale networks was described as a means of detecting the possible metabolic control steps. However, in order to perform TFA, many simplifying assumptions were necessary. On the other hand, it has been shown by applying TFA to the well-known pathway of glycolysis that erroneous simplifying assumptions may seriously bias the results of the analysis. A quantitative analysis of the influence of non-ideality of the biochemical system, pH, temperature, and complexation of the metabolites with Mg(2+) ions as well as a number of other factors on the TFA is reported. It is shown that the feasibility of glycolysis is very seriously limited by the reaction of oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde phosphate, and that the intracellular concentration of the main product of this reaction, biphosphoglycerate, must be anywhere from 10 to 100 times lower than published values. In addition, the driving force for this reaction, and consequently the feasibility of the entire pathway depend strongly on the intracellular pH and ionic strength and to a lesser extent on pMg and temperature. The analysis may also be influenced by uncertainties of the dissociation and magnesium complexation constants of glyceraldehyde phosphate. The analysis demonstrates the crucial importance of taking such factors into account when performing TFA. It also suggests an urgent need for experimental determinations of such factors as a prerequisite for sensible thermodynamic analysis of metabolism on a genome-wide scale.},

  abstract = {Malaria is a global health problem that threatens 300-500 million people and kills more than one million people annually. Disease control is hampered by the occurrence of multi-drug-resistant strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Synthetic antimalarial drugs and malarial vaccines are currently being developed, but their efficacy against malaria awaits rigorous clinical testing. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide extracted from Artemisia annua L (family Asteraceae; commonly known as sweet wormwood), is highly effective against multi-drug-resistant Plasmodium spp., but is in short supply and unaffordable to most malaria sufferers. Although total synthesis of artemisinin is difficult and costly, the semi-synthesis of artemisinin or any derivative from microbially sourced artemisinic acid, its immediate precursor, could be a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, high-quality and reliable source of artemisinin. Here we report the engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce high titres (up to 100 mg l(-1)) of artemisinic acid using an engineered mevalonate pathway, amorphadiene synthase, and a novel cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP71AV1) from A. annua that performs a three-step oxidation of amorpha-4,11-diene to artemisinic acid. The synthesized artemisinic acid is transported out and retained on the outside of the engineered yeast, meaning that a simple and inexpensive purification process can be used to obtain the desired product. Although the engineered yeast is already capable of producing artemisinic acid at a significantly higher specific productivity than A. annua, yield optimization and industrial scale-up will be required to raise artemisinic acid production to a level high enough to reduce artemisinin combination therapies to significantly below their current prices.},

  abstract = {Cellular biochemical networks have to function in a noisy environment using imperfect components. In particular, networks involved in gene regulation or signal transduction allow only for small output tolerances, and the underlying network structures can be expected to have undergone evolution for inherent robustness against perturbations. Here we combine theoretical and experimental analyses to investigate an optimal design for the signalling network of bacterial chemotaxis, one of the most thoroughly studied signalling networks in biology. We experimentally determine the extent of intercellular variations in the expression levels of chemotaxis proteins and use computer simulations to quantify the robustness of several hypothetical chemotaxis pathway topologies to such gene expression noise. We demonstrate that among these topologies the experimentally established chemotaxis network of Escherichia coli has the smallest sufficiently robust network structure, allowing accurate chemotactic response for almost all individuals within a population. Our results suggest that this pathway has evolved to show an optimal chemotactic performance while minimizing the cost of resources associated with high levels of protein expression. Moreover, the underlying topological design principles compensating for intercellular variations seem to be highly conserved among bacterial chemosensory systems.},

  abstract = {The maintenance of Mg2+ homeostasis in the plant is essential for viability. This review describes Mg2+ functions and balancing in plants, with special focus on the existing knowledge of the involved transport mechanisms. Mg2+ is essential for the function of many cellular enzymes and for the aggregation of ribosomes. Mg2+ concentrations also modulate ionic currents across the chloroplast and the vacuolar membranes, and might thus regulate ion balance in the cell and stomatal opening. The significance of Mg2+ homeostasis has been particularly established with regard to Mg2+'s role in photosynthesis. Mg2+ is the central atom of the chlorophyll molecule, and fluctuations in its levels in the chloroplast regulate the activity of key photosynthetic enzymes. Relatively little is known of the proteins mediating Mg2+ uptake and transport in plants. The plant vacuole seem to play a key role in Mg2+ homeostasis in plant cells. Physiological and molecular evidence indicate that Mg2+ entry to the vacuole is mediated by Mg2+/H+ exchangers. The Arabidopsis vacuolar Mg2+/H+ exchanger, AtMHX, is highly transcribed at the vascular tissue, apparently most abundantly at the xylem parenchyma. Inclusion of Mg2+ ions into the vacuoles of this tissue may determine their partitioning between the various plant organs. Impacts of Mg2+ imbalance are described with respect for both plant physiology and for its nutritional value to animal and human.},

Here we present a mathematical model that relates metabolic partitioning to the form of growth. The model captures the observed growth trajectory of single cells and individuals for a variety of species and taxa spanning prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and small multicellular eukaryotes. Our analysis suggests that the per-unit costs of biosynthesis and maintenance are conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the relative metabolic expenditure on growth and maintenance of whole organisms clearly differentiates taxa: prokaryotes spend an increasing fraction of their entire metabolism on growth with increasing cell size, whereas eukaryotes devote a diminishing fraction. These differences allow us to predict the minimum and maximum size for each taxonomic group, anticipating observed evolutionary life-history transitions. The framework provides energetic insights into taxonomic tradeoffs related to growth and metabolism and constrains traits that are important for size-structured modeling of microbial communities and their ecological and biogeochemical effects.},

Here we propose an in vivo data-driven approach to simultaneously address both problems. We then demonstrate the procedure in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using chemostats to generate a large flux/metabolite dataset, under 32 conditions spanning a large range of fluxes. Reactions were classified as pseudo-, near- or far-from-equilibrium, allowing the complexity of mathematical description to be tailored to the kinetic behavior displayed in vivo. For 3/4 of the reactions we derived fully in vivo-parameterized kinetic descriptions which can be readily incorporated into models. For near-equilibrium reactions this involved a new simplified format, dubbed Q-linear kinetics. We also demonstrate, for the first time, systematic estimation of apparent in vivo K(eq) values. Remarkably, comparison with E. coli data suggests they constitute a suitable in vivo interspecies thermodynamic reference.},

@article{Carlson2002,
  abstract = {Elementary mode analysis has been used to study a metabolic pathway model of a recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae system that was genetically engineered to produce the bacterial storage compound poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). The model includes biochemical reactions from the intermediary metabolism and takes into account cellular compartmentalization as well as the reversibility/irreversibility of the reactions. The reaction network connects the production and/or consumption of eight external metabolites including glucose, acetate, glycerol, ethanol, PHB, CO(2), succinate, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Elementary mode analysis of the wild-type S. cerevisiae system reveals 241 unique reaction combinations that balance the eight external metabolites. When the recombinant PHB pathway is included, and when the reaction model is altered to simulate the experimental conditions when PHB accumulates, the analysis reveals 20 unique elementary modes. Of these 20 modes, 7 produce PHB with the optimal mode having a theoretical PHB carbon yield of 0.67. Elementary mode analysis was also used to analyze the possible effects of biochemical network modifications and altered culturing conditions. When the natively absent ATP citrate-lyase activity is added to the recombinant reaction network, the number of unique modes increases from 20 to 496, with 314 of these modes producing PHB. With this topological modification, the maximum theoretical PHB carbon yield increases from 0.67 to 0.83. Adding a transhydrogenase reaction to the model also improves the theoretical conversion of substrate into PHB. The recombinant system with the transhydrogenase reaction but without the ATP citrate-lyase reaction has an increase in PHB carbon yield from 0.67 to 0.71. When the model includes both the ATP citrate-lyase reaction and the transhydrogenase reaction, the maximum theoretical carbon yield increases to 0.84. The reaction model was also used to explore the possibility of producing PHB under anaerobic conditions. In the absence of oxygen, the recombinant reaction network possesses two elementary modes capable of producing PHB. Interestingly, both modes also produce ethanol. Elementary mode analysis provides a means of deconstructing complex metabolic networks into their basic functional units. This information can be used for analyzing existing pathways and for the rational design of further modifications that could improve the system's conversion of substrate into product.},

Here, we apply flux balance analysis in investigating the effects of single-cell proteomics data on the metabolic behavior of an in silico Escherichia coli population. We use the latest metabolic reconstruction integrated with transcriptional regulatory data to model realistic cells growing in a glucose minimal medium under aerobic conditions. The modeled population exhibits a broad distribution of growth rates, and principal component analysis was used to identify well-defined subpopulations that differ in terms of their pathway use. The cells differentiate into slow-growing acetate-secreting cells and fast-growing CO2-secreting cells, and a large population growing at intermediate rates shift from glycolysis to Entner-Doudoroff pathway use. Constraints imposed by integrating regulatory data have a large impact on NADH oxidizing pathway use within the cell. Finally, we find that stochasticity in the expression of only a few genes may be sufficient to capture most of the metabolic variability of the entire population.},

Recently, a novel class of RNA-based control modules, which act through post-transcriptional processing of transcripts by directed RNase III (Rnt1p) cleavage, were shown to provide predictable control over gene expression and unique properties for manipulating biological networks. Here, we increase the regulatory range of the Rnt1p control elements, by modifying a critical region for enzyme binding to its hairpin substrates, the binding stability box (BSB). We used a high throughput, cell-based selection strategy to screen a BSB library for sequences that exhibit low fluorescence and thus high Rnt1p processing efficiencies. Sixteen unique BSBs were identified that cover a range of protein expression levels, due to the ability of the sequences to affect the hairpin cleavage rate and to form active cleavable complexes with Rnt1p. We further demonstrated that the activity of synthetic Rnt1p hairpins can be rationally programmed by combining the synthetic BSBs with a set of sequences located within a different region of the hairpin that directly modulate cleavage rates, providing a modular assembly strategy for this class of RNA-based control elements.},

We have focused on developing pathways for next-generation biofuels as they require carbon to be channeled to product at quantitative yields. However, these fatty acid-inspired pathways must manage the highly reversible nature of the enzyme components. For targets in the biodiesel range, the equilibrium can be driven to completion by physical sequestration of an insoluble product, which is a mechanism unavailable to soluble gasoline-sized products. In this work, we report the construction of a chimeric pathway assembled from three different organisms for the high-level production of n-butanol (4,650 $\pm$ 720 mg l(-1)) that uses an enzymatic chemical reaction mechanism in place of a physical step as a kinetic control element to achieve high yields from glucose (28\%).},

In an effort to recruit these advantages for in vitro biotransformations, we have assembled a 10-step catalytic system-a system of biotransformations (SBT)-for the synthesis of unnatural monosaccharides based on the versatile building block dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). To facilitate the assembly of such a network, we have insulated a production pathway from Escherichia coli's central carbon metabolism. This pathway consists of the endogenous glycolysis without triose-phosphate isomerase to enable accumulation of DHAP and was completed with lactate dehydrogenase to regenerate NAD(+). It could be readily extended for the synthesis of unnatural sugar molecules, such as the unnatural monosaccharide phosphate 5,6,7-trideoxy-D-threo-heptulose-1-phosphate from DHAP and butanal. Insulation required in particular inactivation of the amn gene encoding the AMP nucleosidase, which otherwise led to glucose-independent DHAP production from adenosine phosphates. The work demonstrates that a sufficiently insulated in vitro multi-step enzymatic system can be readily assembled from central carbon metabolism pathways.},

We analyzed the probabilistic and transient differentiation of Bacillus subtilis cells into the state of competence. A few key parameters independently tuned the frequency of initiation and the duration of competence episodes and allowed the circuit to access different dynamic regimes, including oscillation. Altering circuit architecture showed that the duration of competence events can be made more precise. We used an experimental method to reduce global cellular noise and showed that noise levels are correlated with frequency of differentiation events. Together, the data reveal a noise-dependent circuit that is remarkably resilient and tunable in terms of its dynamic behavior.},

@article{Milletti2007,
  abstract = {One of the most important physicochemical properties of a molecule is pKa. It is known that two parameters imperative in ADME profiling, solubility, and lipophilicity are governed by pKa, and receptor binding can be influenced by pKa. Because most drugs are ionized in physiological conditions, pKa is particularly relevant to medicinal chemistry. Despite the numerous advances in high-throughput measurements, in silico determination is still the fastest and cheapest way of obtaining pKa. This paper presents a new original computational method for pKa prediction of organic compounds. Descriptors were generated using the program GRID, and these descriptors are based on molecular interaction fields precomputed on a set of molecular fragments. The new method was developed, trained, and cross-validated by using a large and diverse data set of 24 617 pKa values. This paper presents the results for a class of 421 acidic nitrogen compounds (RMSE = 0.41, r2 = 0.97, q2 = 0.87) and for a class of 947 six-membered N-heterocyclic bases (RMSE = 0.60, r2 = 0.93, q2 = 0.85). For external validation 28 novel compounds were selected that covered nine different ionizable groups, and 39 pKa values could be experimentally determined by spectral gradient analysis (SGA). Comparison of experimental pKa with calculated pKa demonstrated that the predictive ability of the method is good (external set, r2 = 0.85, RMSE = 0.90).},

Within this modeling framework, linear optimization has been used to study genome-scale metabolic models, resulting in the enumeration of single optimal solutions describing the best use of the network to support growth. Here mixed-integer linear programming was used to calculate and study a subset of the alternate optimal solutions for a genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli (iJR904) under a wide variety of environmental conditions. Analysis of the calculated sets of optimal solutions found that: (1) only a small subset of reactions in the network have variable fluxes across optima; (2) sets of reactions that are always used together in optimal solutions, correlated reaction sets, showed moderate agreement with the currently known transcriptional regulatory structure in E. coli and available expression data, and (3) reactions that are used under certain environmental conditions can provide clues about network regulatory needs. In addition, calculation of suboptimal flux distributions, using flux variability analysis, identified reactions which are used under significantly more environmental conditions suboptimally than optimally. Together these results demonstrate the utilization of reactions in genome-scale models under a variety of different growth conditions.},

In many algorithms in engineering and science, such as the force method in structural analysis, the dual variable method for the Navier-Stokes equations or more generally null space methods in quadratic programming, it is necessary to compute a basis matrixB for the null space ofA. HereB isn{\texttimes}r, r=n-m, of rankr, withAB=0. In many instancesA is large and sparse and often banded. The purpose of this paper is to describe and test a variation of a method originally suggested by Topcu and called the turnback algorithm for computing a banded basis matrixB. Two implementations of the algorithm are given, one using Gaussian elimination and the other using orthogonal factorization by Givens rotations. The FORTRAN software was executed on an IBM 3081 computer with an FPS-164 attached array processor at the Triangle Universities Computing Center and on a CYBER 205 vector computer. Test results on a variety of structural analysis problems including two- and three-dimensional frames, plane stress, plate bending and mixed finite element problems are discussed. These results indicate that both implementations of the algorithm yielded a well-conditioned, banded, basis matrixB whenA is well-conditioned. However, the orthogonal implementation yielded a better conditionedB for large, illconditioned problems.},

By combinatorially pairing genes with a compact set of ribosome-binding sites, we modulate protein abundance by several orders of magnitude. We demonstrate our strategy by using a synthetic operon containing fluorescent proteins to span a 3D color space. Using the same approach, we modulate a recombinant carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to reveal a diversity of phenotypes, each characterized by a distinct carotenoid accumulation profile. In a single combinatorial assembly, we achieve a yield of the industrially valuable compound astaxanthin 4-fold higher than previously reported.

  abstract = {Microbial engineering often requires fine control over protein expression--for example, to connect genetic circuits or control flux through a metabolic pathway. To circumvent the need for trial and error optimization, we developed a predictive method for designing synthetic ribosome binding sites, enabling a rational control over the protein expression level. Experimental validation of >100 predictions in Escherichia coli showed that the method is accurate to within a factor of 2.3 over a range of 100,000-fold. The design method also correctly predicted that reusing identical ribosome binding site sequences in different genetic contexts can result in different protein expression levels. We demonstrate the method's utility by rationally optimizing protein expression to connect a genetic sensor to a synthetic circuit. The proposed forward engineering approach should accelerate the construction and systematic optimization of large genetic systems.},

The raw data and documented estimations of solution properties are made electronically available.

The resulting calculations provide thermodynamic and network-based estimates of thermodynamic properties for six reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway for which estimates are not available in the preexisting literature. Optimized results are made available in ThermoML format. Because calculations depend on estimated hydrogen and metal cation dissociation constants, an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is performed, revealing 23 critical dissociation constants to which the computed thermodynamic properties are particularly sensitive.

@article{Northen2007,
  abstract = {The ability of mass spectrometry to generate intact biomolecular ions efficiently in the gas phase has led to its widespread application in metabolomics, proteomics, biological imaging, biomarker discovery and clinical assays (namely neonatal screens). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization have been at the forefront of these developments. However, matrix application complicates the use of MALDI for cellular, tissue, biofluid and microarray analysis and can limit the spatial resolution because of the matrix crystal size (typically more than 10 mum), sensitivity and detection of small compounds (less than 500 Da). Secondary-ion mass spectrometry has extremely high lateral resolution (100 nm) and has found biological applications although the energetic desorption/ionization is a limitation owing to molecular fragmentation. Here we introduce nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS), a tool for spatially defined mass analysis. NIMS uses 'initiator' molecules trapped in nanostructured surfaces or 'clathrates' to release and ionize intact molecules adsorbed on the surface. This surface responds to both ion and laser irradiation. The lateral resolution (ion-NIMS about 150 nm), sensitivity, matrix-free and reduced fragmentation of NIMS allows direct characterization of peptide microarrays, direct mass analysis of single cells, tissue imaging, and direct characterization of blood and urine.},

@article{Haggie2002,
  abstract = {It has been proposed that enzymes in many metabolic pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the mitochondrial matrix, are physically associated to facilitate substrate channeling and overcome diffusive barriers. We have used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to measure the diffusional mobilities of chimeras consisting of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the C terminus of four tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes: malate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and succinyl-CoA synthetase. The GFP-enzyme chimeras were localized selectively in the mitochondrial matrix in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and COS7 cells. Laser photobleaching using a 0.7-microm diameter spot demonstrated restricted diffusion of the GFP-enzyme chimeras. Interestingly, all four chimeras had similar diffusional characteristics, approximately 45\% of each chimera was mobile and had a diffusion coefficient of 4 x 10(-8) cm(2)/s. In contrast, unconjugated GFP in the mitochondrial matrix (targeted using COX8 leader sequence) diffused freely (nearly 100\% mobility) with a greater diffusion coefficient of 20 x 10(-8) cm(2)/s. The mobility of the GFP-enzyme chimeras was insensitive to substrate source, ATP depletion, or inhibition of the adenine nucleotide translocase. These results indicate similar mobility characteristics of unrelated tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes having different sizes and physical properties, providing biophysical evidence for a diffusible multienzyme complex in the mitochondrial matrix.},

  abstract = {When a reaction system described in terms of species is in a certain state, the Gibbs energy G provides the means for determining whether each reaction will go to the right or the left, and the equilibrium composition of the whole system can be calculated using G. When the pH is specified, a system of biochemical reactions is described in terms of reactants, like ATP (a sum of species), and the transformed Gibbs energy G' provides the means for determining whether each reaction will go to the right or the left. The equilibrium composition of the whole system can be calculated using G'. Since metabolism is complicated, the thermodynamics of systems of reactions like glycolysis and the citric acid cycle can also be considered at specified concentrations of coenzymes like ATP, ADP, NAD(ox), and NAD(red). This is of interest because coenzymes tend to be in steady states because they are involved in many reactions. When the concentrations of coenzymes are constant, the further transformed Gibbs energy G provides the means for calculating whether each reaction will go to the right or the left, and the equilibrium composition of the whole system can be calculated using G. Under these conditions, a metabolic reaction system can be reconceptualized in terms of sums of reactants; for example, glycolysis can be represented by C(6)=2C(3), where C(6) is the sum of the reactants with six carbon atoms and C(3) is the sum of the reactants with three carbon atoms. These calculations can also be described by use of semigrand partition functions. Semigrand partition functions have the advantage of containing all the thermodynamic information on a series of reactions at specified pH or at specified pH and specified concentrations of coenzymes.},

We propose three alternative relationships between enzyme capacity and metabolite concentration alterations based on a Michaelis-Menten kinetic; that is enzyme capacities, metabolite concentrations, or both could limit the metabolic reaction rates. These relationships imply different correlations between changes in enzyme capacity and metabolite concentration, which we tested by quantifying metabolite, transcript, and enzyme abundances upon local (single-enzyme modulation) and global (GCR2 transcription factor mutant) perturbations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results reveal an inverse relationship between fold-changes in substrate metabolites and their catalyzing enzymes. These data provide evidence for the hypothesis that reaction rates are jointly limited by enzyme capacity and metabolite concentration. Hence, alteration in one network constituent can be efficiently buffered by converse alterations in the other constituent, implying a passive mechanism to maintain metabolic homeostasis upon perturbations in enzyme capacity.},

The metabolic cost associated with the production of amino acids and (recombinant) proteins from glucose, glycerol and acetate was determined using three different computational techniques to identify those amino acids that put the highest burden on the biosynthetic machinery of E. coli. Comparing the costs of individual amino acids, we find that methionine is the most expensive amino acid in terms of consumed mol of ATP per molecule produced, while leucine is the most expensive amino acid when taking into account the cellular abundances of amino acids. Moreover, we show that the biosynthesis of a large number of amino acids from glucose and particularly from glycerol provides a surplus of energy, which can be used to balance the high energetic cost of amino acid polymerization.},

The reason is that static component concentrations, albeit extremely informative, do not contain functional information per se. The functional behavior of a network emerges only through the nonlinear gene, protein, and metabolite interactions across multiple metabolic and regulatory layers. I argue here that intracellular reaction rates are the functional end points of these interactions in metabolic networks, hence are highly relevant for systems biology. Methods for experimental determination of metabolic fluxes differ fundamentally from component concentration measurements; that is, intracellular reaction rates cannot be detected directly, but must be estimated through computer model-based interpretation of stable isotope patterns in products of metabolism.},

@article{Keller2014,
  abstract = {The reaction sequences of central metabolism, glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway provide essential precursors for nucleic acids, amino acids and lipids. However, their evolutionary origins are not yet understood. Here, we provide evidence that their structure could have been fundamentally shaped by the general chemical environments in earth's earliest oceans. We reconstructed potential scenarios for oceans of the prebiotic Archean based on the composition of early sediments. We report that the resultant reaction milieu catalyses the interconversion of metabolites that in modern organisms constitute glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. The 29 observed reactions include the formation and/or interconversion of glucose, pyruvate, the nucleic acid precursor ribose-5-phosphate and the amino acid precursor erythrose-4-phosphate, antedating reactions sequences similar to that used by the metabolic pathways. Moreover, the Archean ocean mimetic increased the stability of the phosphorylated intermediates and accelerated the rate of intermediate reactions and pyruvate production. The catalytic capacity of the reconstructed ocean milieu was attributable to its metal content. The reactions were particularly sensitive to ferrous iron Fe(II), which is understood to have had high concentrations in the Archean oceans. These observations reveal that reaction sequences that constitute central carbon metabolism could have been constrained by the iron-rich oceanic environment of the early Archean. The origin of metabolism could thus date back to the prebiotic world.},

@article{Schuster2010,
  abstract = {Elementary-modes analysis has become a well-established theoretical tool in metabolic pathway analysis. It allows one to decompose complex metabolic networks into the smallest functional entities, which can be interpreted as biochemical pathways. This analysis has, in medium-size metabolic networks, led to the successful theoretical prediction of hitherto unknown pathways. For illustration, we discuss the example of the phosphoenolpyruvate-glyoxylate cycle in Escherichia coli. Elementary-modes analysis meets with the problem of combinatorial explosion in the number of pathways with increasing system size, which has hampered scaling it up to genome-wide models. We present a novel approach to overcoming this obstacle. That approach is based on elementary flux patterns, which are defined as sets of reactions representing the basic routes through a particular subsystem that are compatible with admissible fluxes in a (possibly) much larger metabolic network. The subsystem can be made up by reactions in which we are interested in, for example, reactions producing a certain metabolite. This allows one to predict novel metabolic pathways in genome-scale networks.},

@article{Bar-Even2010,
  abstract = {Carbon fixation is the process by which CO(2) is incorporated into organic compounds. In modern agriculture in which water, light, and nutrients can be abundant, carbon fixation could become a significant growth-limiting factor. Hence, increasing the fixation rate is of major importance in the road toward sustainability in food and energy production. There have been recent attempts to improve the rate and specificity of Rubisco, the carboxylating enzyme operating in the Calvin-Benson cycle; however, they have achieved only limited success. Nature employs several alternative carbon fixation pathways, which prompted us to ask whether more efficient novel synthetic cycles could be devised. Using the entire repertoire of approximately 5,000 metabolic enzymes known to occur in nature, we computationally identified alternative carbon fixation pathways that combine existing metabolic building blocks from various organisms. We compared the natural and synthetic pathways based on physicochemical criteria that include kinetics, energetics, and topology. Our study suggests that some of the proposed synthetic pathways could have significant quantitative advantages over their natural counterparts, such as the overall kinetic rate. One such cycle, which is predicted to be two to three times faster than the Calvin-Benson cycle, employs the most effective carboxylating enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, using the core of the naturally evolved C4 cycle. Although implementing such alternative cycles presents daunting challenges related to expression levels, activity, stability, localization, and regulation, we believe our findings suggest exciting avenues of exploration in the grand challenge of enhancing food and renewable fuel production via metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.},

Today these cycles continue to occur in more specialized niches. In this review we focus on the bioenergetic aspects of one of these cycles - the iron cycle - because iron presents unique and fascinating challenges for cells that use it for energy. Although iron is an important nutrient for nearly all life forms, we restrict our discussion to energy-yielding pathways that use ferrous iron [Fe(II)] as an electron donor or ferric iron [Fe(III)] as an electron acceptor. We briefly review general concepts in bioenergetics, focusing on what is known about the mechanisms of electron transfer in Fe(II)-oxidizing and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria, and highlight aspects of their bioenergetic pathways that are poorly understood.},

Results from computer simulation that suggest otherwise [Mendes, P., Kell, D. B. \& Westerhoff, H. V. (1992) Eur. J.

This makes it possible to calculate apparent equilibrium constants for a number of enzyme-catalyzed reactions for which apparent equilibrium constants have not been measured or cannot be measured directly because they are too large. The eventual elimination of this convention is discussed. This adds ten reactants to the database BasicBiochemData3 that has 199 reactants. The standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation of these ten reactants are used to calculate apparent equilibrium constants at 298.15 K, 0.25 M ionic strength, and pHs 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

@article{Graham2007,
  abstract = {In Arabidopsis thaliana, enzymes of glycolysis are present on the surface of mitochondria and free in the cytosol. The functional significance of this dual localization has now been established by demonstrating that the extent of mitochondrial association is dependent on respiration rate in both Arabidopsis cells and potato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers. Thus, inhibition of respiration with KCN led to a proportional decrease in the degree of association, whereas stimulation of respiration by uncoupling, tissue ageing, or overexpression of invertase led to increased mitochondrial association. In all treatments, the total activity of the glycolytic enzymes in the cell was unaltered, indicating that the existing pools of each enzyme repartitioned between the cytosol and the mitochondria. Isotope dilution experiments on isolated mitochondria, using (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor the impact of unlabeled glycolytic intermediates on the production of downstream intermediates derived from (13)C-labeled precursors, provided direct evidence for the occurrence of variable levels of substrate channeling. Pull-down experiments suggest that interaction with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein, VDAC, anchors glycolytic enzymes to the mitochondrial surface. It appears that glycolytic enzymes associate dynamically with mitochondria to support respiration and that substrate channeling restricts the use of intermediates by competing metabolic pathways.},

In vitro, protein waves emerge from the self-organization of MinD, a membrane-binding ATPase, and its activator MinE. For wave propagation, the proteins need to cycle through states of collective membrane binding and unbinding. Although MinD presumably undergoes cooperative membrane attachment, it is unclear how synchronous detachment is coordinated. We used confocal and single-molecule microscopy to elucidate the order of events during Min wave propagation. We propose that protein detachment at the rear of the wave, and the formation of the E-ring, are accomplished by two complementary processes: first, local accumulation of MinE due to rapid rebinding, leading to dynamic instability; and second, a structural change induced by membrane-interaction of MinE in an equimolar MinD-MinE (MinDE) complex, which supports the robustness of pattern formation.},

Sequencing aggregate DNA revealed selection for a mutation that enhances the production of a c-type cytochrome involved in extracellular electron transfer and accelerates the formation of aggregates. Aggregate formation was also much faster in mutants that were deficient in interspecies hydrogen transfer, further suggesting direct interspecies electron transfer.},

PRIME uses an engineered fluorophore ligase, which is derived from the natural Escherichia coli enzyme lipoic acid ligase (LplA). Through structure-guided mutagenesis, we created a mutant ligase capable of recognizing a 7-hydroxycoumarin substrate and catalyzing its covalent conjugation to a transposable 13-amino acid peptide called LAP (LplA Acceptor Peptide). We showed that this fluorophore ligation occurs in cells in 10 min and that it is highly specific for LAP fusion proteins over all endogenous mammalian proteins. By genetically targeting the PRIME ligase to specific subcellular compartments, we were able to selectively label spatially distinct subsets of proteins, such as the surface pool of neurexin and the nuclear pool of actin.},

  abstract = {Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is a powerful technique for elucidating in vivo fluxes in microbial and mammalian systems. A key step in (13)C-MFA is the selection of an appropriate isotopic tracer to observe fluxes in a proposed network model. Despite the importance of MFA in metabolic engineering and beyond, current approaches for tracer experiment design are still largely based on trial-and-error. The lack of a rational methodology for selecting isotopic tracers prevents MFA from achieving its full potential. Here, we introduce a new technique for tracer experiment design based on the concept of elementary metabolite unit (EMU) basis vectors. We demonstrate that any metabolite in a network model can be expressed as a linear combination of so-called EMU basis vectors, where the corresponding coefficients indicate the fractional contribution of the EMU basis vector to the product metabolite. The strength of this approach is the decoupling of substrate labeling, i.e. the EMU basis vectors, from the dependence on free fluxes, i.e. the coefficients. In this work, we demonstrate that flux observability inherently depends on the number of independent EMU basis vectors and the sensitivities of coefficients with respect to free fluxes. Specifically, the number of independent EMU basis vectors places hard limits on how many free fluxes can be determined in a model. This constraint is used as a guide for selecting feasible substrate labeling. In three example models, we demonstrate that by maximizing the number of independent EMU basis vectors the observability of a system is improved. Inspection of sensitivities of coefficients with respect to free fluxes provides additional constraints for proper selection of tracers. The present contribution provides a fresh perspective on an important topic in metabolic engineering, and gives practical guidelines and design principles for a priori selection of isotopic tracers for (13)C-MFA studies.},

  abstract = {The fixation of CO{} into living matter sustains all life on Earth, and embeds the biosphere within geochemistry. The six known chemical pathways used by extant organisms for this function are recognized to have overlaps, but their evolution is incompletely understood. Here we reconstruct the complete early evolutionary history of biological carbon-fixation, relating all modern pathways to a single ancestral form. We find that innovations in carbon-fixation were the foundation for most major early divergences in the tree of life. These findings are based on a novel method that fully integrates metabolic and phylogenetic constraints. Comparing gene-profiles across the metabolic cores of deep-branching organisms and requiring that they are capable of synthesizing all their biomass components leads to the surprising conclusion that the most common form for deep-branching autotrophic carbon-fixation combines two disconnected sub-networks, each supplying carbon to distinct biomass components. One of these is a linear folate-based pathway of CO{} reduction previously only recognized as a fixation route in the complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, but which more generally may exclude the final step of synthesizing acetyl-CoA. Using metabolic constraints we then reconstruct a phylometabolic tree with a high degree of parsimony that traces the evolution of complete carbon-fixation pathways, and has a clear structure down to the root. This tree requires few instances of lateral gene transfer or convergence, and instead suggests a simple evolutionary dynamic in which all divergences have primary environmental causes. Energy optimization and oxygen toxicity are the two strongest forces of selection. The root of this tree combines the reductive citric acid cycle and the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway into a single connected network. This linked network lacks the selective optimization of modern fixation pathways but its redundancy leads to a more robust topology, making it more plausible than any modern pathway as a primitive universal ancestral form.},

  abstract = {Glucose catabolism of Pseudomonas putida is carried out exclusively through the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway due to the absence of 6-phosphofructokinase. In order to activate the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) route we transferred the pfkA gene from Escherichia coli to a P.{\hspace{0.167em}}putida wild-type strain as well as to an eda mutant, i.e. lacking 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase. PfkA(E.{\hspace{0.167em}}coli) failed to redirect the carbon flow from the ED route towards the EMP pathway, suggesting that ED was essential for sugar catabolism. The presence of PfkA(E.{\hspace{0.167em}}coli) was detrimental for growth, which could be traced to the reduction of ATP and NAD(P)H pools along with alteration of the NAD(P)H/NADP(+) ratio. Pseudomonas putida cells carrying PfkA(E.{\hspace{0.167em}}coli) became highly sensitive to diamide and hydrogen peroxide, the response to which is very demanding of NADPH. The inhibitory effect of PfkA(E.{\hspace{0.167em}}coli) could in part be relieved by methionine, the synthesis of which relies much on NADPH. These results expose the role of the ED pathway for generating the redox currency (NADPH) that is required for counteracting oxidative stress. It is thus likely that environmental bacteria that favour the ED pathway over the EMP pathway do so in order to gear their aerobic metabolism to endure oxidative-related insults.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The laws of thermodynamics describe a direct, quantitative relationship between metabolite concentrations and reaction directionality. Despite great efforts, thermodynamic data suffers from limited coverage, scattered accessibility and non-standard annotations. We present a framework for unifying thermodynamic data from multiple sources and demonstrate two new techniques for extrapolating the Gibbs energies of unmeasured reactions and conditions. RESULTS: Both methods account for changes in cellular conditions (pH, ionic strength, etc.) by using linear regression over the $\Delta$G{\textdegree} of pseudoisomers and reactions. The Pseudoisomeric Reactant Contribution method systematically infers compound formation energies using measured K' and pK(a) data. The Pseudoisomeric Group Contribution method extends the group contribution method and achieves a high coverage of unmeasured reactions. We define a continuous index that predicts the reversibility of a reaction under a given physiological concentration range. In the characteristic physiological range 3$\mu$M - 3mM we find that roughly half of the reactions in E. coli's metabolism are reversible. These new tools will increase the accuracy of thermodynamic-based models, especially in non-standard pH and ionic strengths. The reversibility index will help modelers decide which reactions are reversible in physiological conditions. AVAILABILITY: Freely available on the web at: http://equilibrator.weizmann.ac.il.

  abstract = {The quantitative analysis of biochemical reactions and metabolites is at frontier of biological sciences. The recent availability of high-throughput technology data sets in biology has paved the way for new modelling approaches at various levels of complexity including the metabolome of a cell or an organism. Understanding the metabolism of a single cell and multi-cell organism will provide the knowledge for the rational design of growth conditions to produce commercially valuable reagents in biotechnology. Here, we demonstrate how equations representing steady state mass conservation, energy conservation, the second law of thermodynamics, and reversible enzyme kinetics can be formulated as a single system of linear equalities and inequalities, in addition to linear equalities on exponential variables. Even though the feasible set is non-convex, the reformulation is exact and amenable to large-scale numerical analysis, a prerequisite for computationally feasible genome scale modelling. Integrating flux, concentration and kinetic variables in a unified constraint-based formulation is aimed at increasing the quantitative predictive capacity of flux balance analysis. Incorporation of experimental and theoretical bounds on thermodynamic and kinetic variables ensures that the predicted steady state fluxes are both thermodynamically and biochemically feasible. The resulting in silico predictions are tested against fluxomic data for central metabolism in Escherichia coli and compare favourably with in silico prediction by flux balance analysis.},

@article{Gore2009,
  abstract = {The origin of cooperation is a central challenge to our understanding of evolution. The fact that microbial interactions can be manipulated in ways that animal interactions cannot has led to a growing interest in microbial models of cooperation and competition. For the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to grow on sucrose, the disaccharide must first be hydrolysed by the enzyme invertase. This hydrolysis reaction is performed outside the cytoplasm in the periplasmic space between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. Here we demonstrate that the vast majority ( approximately 99 per cent) of the monosaccharides created by sucrose hydrolysis diffuse away before they can be imported into the cell, serving to make invertase production and secretion a cooperative behaviour. A mutant cheater strain that does not produce invertase is able to take advantage of and invade a population of wild-type cooperator cells. However, over a wide range of conditions, the wild-type cooperator can also invade a population of cheater cells. Therefore, we observe steady-state coexistence between the two strains in well-mixed culture resulting from the fact that rare strategies outperform common strategies-the defining features of what game theorists call the snowdrift game. A model of the cooperative interaction incorporating nonlinear benefits explains the origin of this coexistence. We are able to alter the outcome of the competition by varying either the cost of cooperation or the glucose concentration in the media. Finally, we note that glucose repression of invertase expression in wild-type cells produces a strategy that is optimal for the snowdrift game-wild-type cells cooperate only when competing against cheater cells.},

The more realistic KD values of Mg furaptra and MgATP measured under in situ conditions are higher than the KDs used by most investigators. The [Mg2+]is obtained and the KDs used by various authors were presented. The role of intracellular Mg2, in metabolic functions and the action of various effectors on [Mg2+]i and [Ca2+] was reviewed. Intracellular Mg2+ may have a permissive role supporting the effector-induced mechanisms that are mediated by Ca2+ as a second messenger.},

  abstract = {1-Butanol, an important chemical feedstock and advanced biofuel, is produced by Clostridium species. Various efforts have been made to transfer the clostridial 1-butanol pathway into other microorganisms. However, in contrast to similar compounds, only limited titers of 1-butanol were attained. In this work, we constructed a modified clostridial 1-butanol pathway in Escherichia coli to provide an irreversible reaction catalyzed by trans-enoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase (Ter) and created NADH and acetyl-CoA driving forces to direct the flux. We achieved high-titer (30 g/liter) and high-yield (70 to 88\% of the theoretical) production of 1-butanol anaerobically, comparable to or exceeding the levels demonstrated by native producers. Without the NADH and acetyl-CoA driving forces, the Ter reaction alone only achieved about 1/10 the level of production. The engineered host platform also enables the selection of essential enzymes with better catalytic efficiency or expression by anaerobic growth rescue. These results demonstrate the importance of driving forces in the efficient production of nonnative products.},

@article{Kovarova-Kovar1998a,
  abstract = {Growth kinetics, i.e., the relationship between specific growth rate and the concentration of a substrate, is one of the basic tools in microbiology. However, despite more than half a century of research, many fundamental questions about the validity and application of growth kinetics as observed in the laboratory to environmental growth conditions are still unanswered. For pure cultures growing with single substrates, enormous inconsistencies exist in the growth kinetic data reported. The low quality of experimental data has so far hampered the comparison and validation of the different growth models proposed, and only recently have data collected from nutrient-controlled chemostat cultures allowed us to compare different kinetic models on a statistical basis. The problems are mainly due to (i) the analytical difficulty in measuring substrates at growth-controlling concentrations and (ii) the fact that during a kinetic experiment, particularly in batch systems, microorganisms alter their kinetic properties because of adaptation to the changing environment. For example, for Escherichia coli growing with glucose, a physiological long-term adaptation results in a change in KS for glucose from some 5 mg liter-1 to ca. 30 microg liter-1. The data suggest that a dilemma exists, namely, that either intrinsic KS (under substrate-controlled conditions in chemostat culture) or micromax (under substrate-excess conditions in batch culture) can be measured but both cannot be determined at the same time. The above-described conventional growth kinetics derived from single-substrate-controlled laboratory experiments have invariably been used for describing both growth and substrate utilization in ecosystems. However, in nature, microbial cells are exposed to a wide spectrum of potential substrates, many of which they utilize simultaneously (in particular carbon sources). The kinetic data available to date for growth of pure cultures in carbon-controlled continuous culture with defined mixtures of two or more carbon sources (including pollutants) clearly demonstrate that simultaneous utilization results in lowered residual steady-state concentrations of all substrates. This should result in a competitive advantage of a cell capable of mixed-substrate growth because it can grow much faster at low substrate concentrations than one would expect from single-substrate kinetics. Additionally, the relevance of the kinetic principles obtained from defined culture systems with single, mixed, or multicomponent substrates to the kinetics of pollutant degradation as it occurs in the presence of alternative carbon sources in complex environmental systems is discussed. The presented overview indicates that many of the environmentally relevant apects in growth kinetics are still waiting to be discovered, established, and exploited.},

Version 2.0 of the COBRA Toolbox expands the scope of computations by including in silico analysis methods developed since its original release. New functions include (i) network gap filling, (ii) (13)C analysis, (iii) metabolic engineering, (iv) omics-guided analysis and (v) visualization. As with the first version, the COBRA Toolbox reads and writes systems biology markup language-formatted models. In version 2.0, we improved performance, usability and the level of documentation. A suite of test scripts can now be used to learn the core functionality of the toolbox and validate results. This toolbox lowers the barrier of entry to use powerful COBRA methods.},

@article{Alves2001,
  abstract = {It has been observed experimentally that most unbranched biosynthetic pathways have irreversible reactions near their beginning, many times at the first step. If there were no functional reasons for this fact, then one would expect irreversible reactions to be equally distributed among all positions in such pathways. Since this is not the case, we have attempted to identify functional consequences of having an irreversible reaction early in the pathway. We systematically varied the position of the irreversible reaction in model pathways and compared the resulting systemic behavior according to several criteria for functional effectiveness, using the method of mathematically controlled comparisons. This technique minimizes extraneous differences in systemic behavior and identifies those that are fundamental. Our results show that a pathway with an irreversible reaction located at the first step, and with all other reactions reversible, is on average better than an otherwise equivalent pathway with all reactions reversible, which in turn is on average better than an otherwise equivalent pathway with an irreversible reaction located at any step other than the first. Pathways with an irreversible first reaction and low concentrations of intermediates (one of the primary criteria for functional effectiveness) exhibit the following profile when compared to fully reversible pathways: changes in the concentration of intermediates in response to changes in the level of initial substrate are equally low, the robustness of the intermediate concentrations and of the flux is similar, the margins of stability are similar, flux is more responsive to changes in demand for end product, intermediate concentrations are less responsive to changes in demand for end product, and transient times are shorter. These results provide a functional rationale for the positioning of irreversible reactions at the beginning of unbranched biosynthetic pathways.},

For kinetically irreversible reactions, proportionality is obeyed when the substrate concentration is of the same order of magnitude as the K(m) of the reaction. Linearity can be obtained by proper choice of product concentration or alternatively by a linear transformation which allows the description of the system by slightly different parameters. For kinetically reversible reactions, the linear range could be obtained and extended to both sides of equilibrium provided the concentration of the substrate is fixed at a proper value and the affinity is varied by the product concentration. In oxidative phosphorylation, a coupled system of enzymatic reactions, proportional regions are found for both oxidation and phosphorylation. These findings justify the use of linear phenomenological equations in bioenergetics.},

Gibbs free energy contribution values were estimated for 74 distinct molecular substructures and 11 interaction factors using multiple linear regression against a training set of 645 reactions and 224 compounds. The standard error for the fitted values was 1.90 kcal/mol. Cross-validation analysis was utilized to determine the accuracy of the methodology in estimating Delta(r)G'(o) and Delta(f)G'(o) for reactions and compounds not included in the training set, and based on the results of the cross-validation, the standard error involved in these estimations is 2.22 kcal/mol.

@article{Chechik2008,
  abstract = {Significant insight about biological networks arises from the study of network motifs--overly abundant network subgraphs--but such wiring patterns do not specify when and how potential routes within a cellular network are used. To address this limitation, we introduce activity motifs, which capture patterns in the dynamic use of a network. Using this framework to analyze transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism, we find that cells use different timing activity motifs to optimize transcription timing in response to changing conditions: forward activation to produce metabolic compounds efficiently, backward shutoff to rapidly stop production of a detrimental product and synchronized activation for co-production of metabolites required for the same reaction. Measuring protein abundance over a time course reveals that mRNA timing motifs also occur at the protein level. Timing motifs significantly overlap with binding activity motifs, where genes in a linear chain have ordered binding affinity to a transcription factor, suggesting a mechanism for ordered transcription. Finely timed transcriptional regulation is therefore abundant in yeast metabolism, optimizing the organism's adaptation to new environmental conditions.},

We present here the development and application of a new in vitro real-time analysis method for the comprehensive investigation and rational programming of enzyme networks for synthetic tasks. We used this first to rationally and rapidly derive an optimal blueprint for the production of the fine chemical building block dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) via Escherichia coli's highly evolved glycolysis. Second, the method guided the three-step genetic implementation of the blueprint, yielding a synthetic operon with the predicted 2.5-fold-increased glycolytic flux toward DHAP.

@article{Edwards2010,
  abstract = {Grasslands cover more than 20\% of the Earth's terrestrial surface, and their rise to dominance is one of the most dramatic events of biome evolution in Earth history. Grasses possess two main photosynthetic pathways: the C(3) pathway that is typical of most plants and a specialized C(4) pathway that minimizes photorespiration and thus increases photosynthetic performance in high-temperature and/or low-CO(2) environments. C(4) grasses dominate tropical and subtropical grasslands and savannas, and C(3) grasses dominate the world's cooler temperate grassland regions. This striking pattern has been attributed to C(4) physiology, with the implication that the evolution of the pathway enabled C(4) grasses to persist in warmer climates than their C(3) relatives. We combined geospatial and molecular sequence data from two public archives to produce a 1,230-taxon phylogeny of the grasses with accompanying climate data for all species, extracted from more than 1.1 million herbarium specimens. Here we show that grasses are ancestrally a warm-adapted clade and that C(4) evolution was not correlated with shifts between temperate and tropical biomes. Instead, 18 of 20 inferred C(4) origins were correlated with marked reductions in mean annual precipitation. These changes are consistent with a shift out of tropical forest environments and into tropical woodland/savanna systems. We conclude that C(4) evolution in grasses coincided largely with migration out of the understory and into open-canopy environments. Furthermore, we argue that the evolution of cold tolerance in certain C(3) lineages is an overlooked innovation that has profoundly influenced the patterning of grassland communities across the globe.},

Elucidating these relations is important both for understanding the physiological functions of endogenous genetic circuits and for designing robust synthetic systems. We describe a phenomenological study that reveals intrinsic constraints governing the allocation of resources toward protein synthesis and other aspects of cell growth. A theory incorporating these constraints can accurately predict how cell proliferation and gene expression affect one another, quantitatively accounting for the effect of translation-inhibiting antibiotics on gene expression and the effect of gratuitous protein expression on cell growth. The use of such empirical relations, analogous to phenomenological laws, may facilitate our understanding and manipulation of complex biological systems before underlying regulatory circuits are elucidated.},

The lac operon of the bacterium Escherichia coli has been a model for quantifying the physiological impact of costly protein production and for elucidating the resulting regulatory mechanisms. We report quantitative fitness measurements in 27 redesigned operons that suggested that protein production is not the primary origin of fitness costs. Instead, we discovered that the lac permease activity, which relates linearly to cost, is the major physiological burden to the cell. These findings explain control points in the lac operon that minimize the cost of lac permease activity, not protein expression. Characterizing similar relationships in other systems will be important to map the impact of cost/benefit tradeoffs on cell physiology and regulation.},

  abstract = {The design of metabolic pathways is thought to be the result of an optimization process such that the structure of contemporary metabolic routes maximizes a particular objective function. Recently, it has been shown that some essential stoichiometric properties of glycolysis can be explained on the basis of the requirement for a high ATP production rate. Because the number of stoichiometrically feasible designs increases strongly with the number of reactions involved, a systematic analysis of all the possibilities turns out to be inaccessible beyond a certain system size. We present, therefore, an alternative approach to compute in a more efficient way the optimal design of glycolysis interacting with an external ATP-consuming reaction. The algorithm is based on the laws of evolution by natural selection, and may be viewed as a particular version of evolutionary algorithms. The following conclusions are derived: (a) evolutionary algorithms are very useful search strategies in determining optimal stoichiometries of metabolic pathways. (b) Essential topological features of the glycolytic network may be explained on the basis of flux optimization. (c) There is a strong interrelation between the optimal stoichiometries and the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the participating reactions. (d) Some subsequences of reactions in optimal pathways are strongly conserved at variation of system parameters, which may be understood by applying principles of metabolic control analysis.},

Species-level free energies of formation are estimated on the basis of comparing thermodynamic model predictions for reaction-level equilibrium constants to previously reported data obtained under different experimental conditions. Matching model predictions to the data involves applying state corrections for ionic strength, pH, and metal ion binding for each input experimental biochemical measurement. By archiving all of the raw data, documenting all model assumptions and calculations, and making the computer package and data available, this work provides a framework for extension and refinement by adding to the underlying raw experimental data in the database and/or refining the underlying model assumptions. Thus the resulting database is a refinement of preexisting databases of thermodynamics in terms of reliability, self-consistency, transparency, and extensibility.},

  abstract = {We have developed a new method, i.e., XLOGP3, for logP computation. XLOGP3 predicts the logP value of a query compound by using the known logP value of a reference compound as a starting point. The difference in the logP values of the query compound and the reference compound is then estimated by an additive model. The additive model implemented in XLOGP3 uses a total of 87 atom/group types and two correction factors as descriptors. It is calibrated on a training set of 8199 organic compounds with reliable logP data through a multivariate linear regression analysis. For a given query compound, the compound showing the highest structural similarity in the training set will be selected as the reference compound. Structural similarity is quantified based on topological torsion descriptors. XLOGP3 has been tested along with its predecessor, i.e., XLOGP2, as well as several popular logP methods on two independent test sets: one contains 406 small-molecule drugs approved by the FDA and the other contains 219 oligopeptides. On both test sets, XLOGP3 produces more accurate predictions than most of the other methods with average unsigned errors of 0.24-0.51 units. Compared to conventional additive methods, XLOGP3 does not rely on an extensive classification of fragments and correction factors in order to improve accuracy. It is also able to utilize the ever-increasing experimentally measured logP data more effectively.},

  abstract = {Laboratory adaptive evolution studies can provide key information to address a wide range of issues in evolutionary biology. Such studies have been limited thus far by the inability of workers to readily detect mutations in evolved microbial strains on a genome scale. This limitation has now been overcome by recently developed genome sequencing technology that allows workers to identify all accumulated mutations that appear during laboratory adaptive evolution. In this study, we evolved Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 with a nonnative carbon source, l-1,2-propanediol (l-1,2-PDO), for approximately 700 generations. We found that (i) experimental evolution of E. coli for approximately 700 generations in 1,2-PDO-supplemented minimal medium resulted in acquisition of the ability to use l-1,2-PDO as a sole carbon and energy source so that the organism changed from an organism that did not grow at all initially to an organism that had a growth rate of 0.35 h(-1); (ii) six mutations detected by whole-genome resequencing accumulated in the evolved E. coli mutant over the course of adaptive evolution on l-1,2-PDO; (iii) five of the six mutations were within coding regions, and IS5 was inserted between two fuc regulons; (iv) two major mutations (mutations in fucO and its promoter) involved in l-1,2-PDO catabolism appeared early during adaptive evolution; and (v) multiple defined knock-in mutant strains with all of the mutations had growth rates essentially matching that of the evolved strain. These results provide insight into the genetic basis underlying microbial evolution for growth on a nonnative substrate.},

Understanding of these global effects is necessary for a quantitative understanding of gene regulation and for the design of synthetic genetic circuits. We find that the observed growth-rate dependence of constitutive gene expression can be explained by a simple model using the measured growth-rate dependence of the relevant cellular parameters. More complex growth dependencies for genetic circuits involving activators, repressors, and feedback control were analyzed and verified experimentally with synthetic circuits. Additional results suggest a feedback mechanism mediated by general growth-dependent effects that does not require explicit gene regulation if the expressed protein affects cell growth. This mechanism can lead to growth bistability and promote the acquisition of important physiological functions such as antibiotic resistance and tolerance (persistence).},

  abstract = {We studied the relationship between growth rate and genome-wide gene expression, cell cycle progression, and glucose metabolism in 36 steady-state continuous cultures limited by one of six different nutrients (glucose, ammonium, sulfate, phosphate, uracil, or leucine). The expression of more than one quarter of all yeast genes is linearly correlated with growth rate, independent of the limiting nutrient. The subset of negatively growth-correlated genes is most enriched for peroxisomal functions, whereas positively correlated genes mainly encode ribosomal functions. Many (not all) genes associated with stress response are strongly correlated with growth rate, as are genes that are periodically expressed under conditions of metabolic cycling. We confirmed a linear relationship between growth rate and the fraction of the cell population in the G0/G1 cell cycle phase, independent of limiting nutrient. Cultures limited by auxotrophic requirements wasted excess glucose, whereas those limited on phosphate, sulfate, or ammonia did not; this phenomenon (reminiscent of the Warburg effect in cancer cells) was confirmed in batch cultures. Using an aggregate of gene expression values, we predict (in both continuous and batch cultures) an instantaneous growth rate. This concept is useful in interpreting the system-level connections among growth rate, metabolism, stress, and the cell cycle.},

  abstract = {Cells need to allocate their limited resources to express a wide range of genes. To understand how Escherichia coli partitions its transcriptional resources between its different promoters, we employ a robotic assay using a comprehensive reporter strain library for E. coli to measure promoter activity on a genomic scale at high-temporal resolution and accuracy. This allows continuous tracking of promoter activity as cells change their growth rate from exponential to stationary phase in different media. We find a heavy-tailed distribution of promoter activities, with promoter activities spanning several orders of magnitude. While the shape of the distribution is almost completely independent of the growth conditions, the identity of the promoters expressed at different levels does depend on them. Translation machinery genes, however, keep the same relative expression levels in the distribution across conditions, and their fractional promoter activity tracks growth rate tightly. We present a simple optimization model for resource allocation which suggests that the observed invariant distributions might maximize growth rate. These invariant features of the distribution of promoter activities may suggest design constraints that shape the allocation of transcriptional resources.},

@article{Pedersen1978,
  abstract = {The amount of 140 individual proteins of E. coli B/r was measured during balanced growth in five different media. The abundance of each protein was determined from its absolute amount in 14C-glucose-minimal medium and a measurement of its relative amount at each growth rate using a double labeling technique. Separation of the proteins was carried out by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. This catalog of proteins, combined with 50 additional ribosomal proteins already studied, comprises about 5\% of the coding capacity of the genome, but accounts for two thirds of the cell's protein mass. The behavior of most of these proteins could be described by a relatively small number of patterns. 102 of the 140 proteins exhibited nearly linear variations with growth rate. The remaining 38 proteins exhibited levels which seemed to depend more on the chemical nature of the medium than on growth rate. Proteins, including the ribosomal proteins, that increase in amount with increasing growth rate account for 20\% of total cell protein by weight during growth on acetate, 32\% on glucose-minimal medium and 55\% on glucose-rich medium. Proteins with invariant levels in the various media comprise about 4\% of the cell's total protein.},

@article{Weise2015,
abstract = {Intracellular processes rarely work in isolation but continually interact with the rest of the cell. In microbes, for example, we now know that gene expression across the whole genome typically changes with growth rate. The mechanisms driving such global regulation, however, are not well understood. Here we consider three trade-offs that, because of limitations in levels of cellular energy, free ribosomes, and proteins, are faced by all living cells and we construct a mechanistic model that comprises these trade-offs. Our model couples gene expression with growth rate and growth rate with a growing population of cells. We show that the model recovers Monod's law for the growth of microbes and two other empirical relationships connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of ribosomes. Further, we can explain growth-related effects in dosage compensation by paralogs and predict host-circuit interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic pathways may have evolved not to match expression of enzymes to levels of extracellular substrates in changing environments but rather to balance a trade-off between exploiting one type of nutrient over another. Although coarse-grained, the trade-offs that the model embodies are fundamental, and, as such, our modeling framework has potentially wide application, including in both biotechnology and medicine.},
